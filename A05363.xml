            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And no marvaile though they could not direct others vnto that happie eſtate, which they them ſelves ſo earneſtly affected, ſeeing that beſides the darkeneſſe of their owne vnderſtanding, which was wonderfully obſcured with the foggie miſts of clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ignorance, they were for the moſt part wholy directed by thoſe ſame two noyſome neighbours,<note place="margin">Plato in the firſt booke of his lawes.</note> and vnadviſed Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Paine:</hi> whoſe deviſes were accounted as ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp; their ſuggeſtions ſufficient to ſway every action.

            <p>And yet ſurely a wiſe reader may picke out excellent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, as well out of his workes, as out of other philoſophicall diſcourſes, and compounde a potion fitte for the purging of our mindes of much vnquietneſſe, though hee ſhall never bee able to attaine that perfection of ioy and bliſſe, which is here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>For it is not all one to bee a morall wiſe man, and to bee a good Chriſtian; to bee a great proficient in humaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a profounde Clarke in heavenly vnderſtanding; to bee skilfull in the writings of men, and to bee cunning in the booke of God.

            <p>And therefore ſuch as haue bene trayned vp in the ſchoole of Chriſtianitie, and truely taught by the Spirite of God, have learned to avoyde thoſe ſandie foundations, and to builde vpon ſure rockes; the death and merites of <hi>Christ Ieſus:</hi> and to looke for all happineſſe and tranquillitie both of minde and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the aſſured perſwaſion of the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes:<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> which ſtrong foundation neither the ſtormie tempeſtes of carnall motions,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.23.</note> nor the bluſtering windes of diveliſh ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall ever be able to ſhake.</p>

And though I feared at the firſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any tranſlation thereof to the preſſe, being moſt vnwilling to lay open mine owne inſufficiencie in the tongue to the viewe of the skilfull Reader, but to vſe it rather as an exerciſe for mine owne particuler: yet being perſwaded to the contrarie by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the correſpondencie that ought to bee among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the good that ſo neceſſarie a worke may doe in theſe dayes, wherein mens mindes through the pollicie of Sathan and the corruption of their owne natures, ſeeme to be but too full of paſſionate humours, I was the rather enduced to venture neere home like a young merchant, and to make tryall howe theſe precious French wares will be vttered among our Engliſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at this preſent, who haue (I am ſure heretofore) bene but too much delighted with their baſer commodities.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Verie man naturally endeuoureth by all means poſſible to liue quietly,<note place="margin">All men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue happely.</note> &amp; ſeeketh continually to ſettle himſelfe in that eſtate, which he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be moſt to his liking and contentation: and to this end tendeth all his labour, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, deliberations, thoughtes, actions, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and enterpriſes whatſoeuer. Which though it be moſt true, yet doe they not take one, &amp; the ſelfe ſame courſe to attaine vnto their wiſhed end: for ſome thinking felicitie to conſiſt in riches, doe ſeeke for nothing elſe as long as they liue, but to gather wealth: others hunt after honour, and promotion, and ſome after pleaſure, and delight: this man is beſt pleaſed with goodly and ſtately buildings, and that other with trauelling into farre Countries: and euerie one applieth himſelfe vnto that, which fitteth his humour and agreeth with his liking. But there is no man ſo fortunate as to find that which he ſeeketh, neither is there any but complaineth of his owne estate and condition: and that in ſuch ſort, as wee may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceiue his vnquietnes, and diſcontentment. The reaſon whereof is this: They ſeeke for that in this world which cannot poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found: for this tranquillitie and repoſe of the minde is laide vp in heauen, and in the kingdome of God, and is beſtowed onely vpon them, who hope to attaine vnto it by the meanes of Chriſt Ieſus: for the contentation, whereof wee now speake, is nothing elſe, but that bleſſed, and happie eſtate, which he hath purchaſed vnto vs by his obedience, which he reſerued for vs, vntill ſuch time, as he appearing
<pb facs="tcp:23951:10"/>vnto all the worlde in his glorie, ſhall make it manifeſt vnto all men. And yet I will not ſay, but that it may appeare in ſome ſort, and be attained vnto eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life: &amp; that true &amp; vnfained Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminated and regenerated, perceiuing the vanitie of this world, and the corruption of all thinges therein, may ſo lift vp their hearts and mindes vnto God, and by a conſideration of his goodneſſe and bountie, finde ſuch quiet and aſſured reſt, as they could neuer before attaine vnto. And to the ende that men may the better come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this quiet aend peaceable estate, I haue in theſe ſeuen bookes ſet downe the meanes that bringeth them thereto: to the end that they, by reading and endeauoring to follow thoſe rules which are deliuered, may in proceſſe of time by the grace of God obtaine their deſire. And though the end be long and difficult, yet is it very excellent, pleaſant, and profitable, and ſo greatly to be deſired, that we ought to spare no trauell or labonr whatſoeuer, to attaine it. For it is ſo precious a lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, as the least part and peece thereof, is ſufficient to recompenſe all our trauels, and paines.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may the better vnderſtand wherein the contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde especially conſisteth, wee muſt firſt ſearch out thoſe things, which doe moſt trouble and diſquiet it. For as in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſeaſes, it is very requiſite to know the cauſes whereof they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to the end we may the ſooner cure them: ſo is it conuenient, the better to appeaſe the trouble ſome paſſions of the minde, to knowe what thoſe things are that haue ingendred them.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, ſome are externall: as pouertie, diſbonour, loſſe, iniurie, enmitie, and ſuch like: and ſome internall. And of theſe there are two ſorts: for ſome haue relation onely to the hodie, as hurts, and diſeaſes: and ſome to the minde, as paſſions, and affections, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and carrie the greatest ſway in the mouing of our spirits. For as we ſee the power of the windes in the motion and ſtirring of the aire, the waters, and the trees eſpecially to preuaile, for that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moueable, and ſubiect to euerie motion: ſo likewiſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why euerie accidentall, and caſuall chance doe trouble, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt vs, is, for that our mindes are incombred with vnſtable, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering paſſions: and therefore it is verie expedient, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this treatiſe we ſet downe the meanes that may purge vs of theſe paſſionate humours.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all it is to be vnderstood, that that which ſhalbe spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:23951:10"/>against theſe trouble ſome paſſions of the minde,<note place="margin">Againſt the opinion of the Stoikes which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men vnſenſible.</note> will not make any thing for the proofe, and approbation of that Stoicall opinion, which maintaineth a ſenſeleſſe and blockiſh nature, voide of all humanitie, and vnderſtanding: for affections are as neceſſarie for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of humane ſocietie, and preſeruation of mutuall concord among men, as bread and drinke are conuenient for their vſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as skilfull Phiſitians, who take vpon them to heale a diſeaſe, doe not purge the bodie of all moisture, but onely of that which is corrupt and putrified, and ſeeke to reduce the reſt to a good and conuenient temperature: ſo likewiſe we muſt not labour to extinguiſb all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our nature, but to weede (as out of a garden) thoſe onely, which are euill: and manure and huſband the reſt, to the end they may bring forth ſome good and wholſome fruite.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt note,<note place="margin">A remedie againſt the paſſions of the mind.</note> that there are no remedies more fit and conuenient to heale the diſeaſes of the mind, then words, reaſons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, diſcourſes and demonſtrations, which doe liuely and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet foorth both vice and vertue, in ſhewing the beautie of the one, to the end to make vs in loue with it, and contrariwiſe in declaring the deteſtable and foule euill fauourednes of the other: thereby the more to make vs hate and loath it. We muſt obſerue then, that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke is not good, vnleſſe it be for ſuch as take it, and for thoſe whoſe natures are well prepared before to receiue the operation therof: and therefore if the reader will obtaine any profite hereby, he muſt reade diligently, and carefully lay vp in his minde thoſe reaſons which ſhalbe alledged, and earneſtly craue at the handes of God, that theſe things may be effectuall to his good: for it is he alone that muſt giue the encreaſe to theſe our labours, which otherwiſe will be altogither vnprofitable and vnfruitfull. We are like vnto them, who ſhewe and teach other the way they ſhould trauell in: they tell them right, and where they ought to turne: but if they fall lame, or waxe wearie by the way, they can not giue them new legges or ſufficient ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell out their iourney. Wherefore ſeeing all dependeth vpon the grace of God, both the knowledge of them who inflruct others, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of thoſe who are taught, to put in practiſe, and to execute the counſels of them who teach them: let vs commend our ſelues vnto him &amp; humbly be ſeech him to giue vs grace that we may both vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and ſtudie earneſtly to doe our diligence and endeuour.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſeemeth that we liue in that age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing is accounted vicious, but words: for as for the thinges themſelues they are currant, and receiueable among vs: as for example, Couetouſneſſe is not condemned, but onely in regard of the name. For as for it ſelfe, all ſortes of people, and all vocations whatſoeuer are miſerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith. Goodmen, being wrapped vp, and as it were ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the nets hereof, are often times beguiled with the vaniſhing Sun-ſhine of this world: &amp; therfore the Poet <hi>Simonides</hi> being asked whether wealth or wiſdome were moſt to be deſired, anſwered, that hee could not tell, for that hee ſawe often times the wiſe to ſtand cap in hand to the wealthie: which thing make many to paſſe on a reſolute courſe to gather riches, vntill they haue entred into the ſchoole of heauenly trueth and veritie, which preſently inſtructeth them in a better way. Nowe as concerning the loue of theſe corruptible and tranſitorie goods, commonly called <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> very fitly in my opinion hath it beene called by wiſe men in former ages, the Metropolitan or mother Citie of all miſchiefe: and the ſpirite of God hath named it the roote of all euill. And of this the authour diſcourſeth in this firſt booke, and ſheweth that it is verie fitly branded with this marke, as being the worſte of all other: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like a ſurgeon ſeeketh to heale that diſeaſe, wherewith hee ſeeth his patient to be moſt troubled. And hauing laid this as a foundation, that Couetouſneſſe is the moſt violent paſſion of all the reſt, hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:23951:11"/>to proue it by particular reaſons, ſhewing that it debarreth vs of the vſe of all things, and will not ſuffer eyther our ſelues or any other to enioy them. Next vnto this he painteth out a covetous man in his orient and lively colours, and maketh him the vildest ſlave in the whole world, the greateſt Idolatour, theife, murtherer, Infidell, Atheist, &amp; damnable creature that is: the author of all euil, the moſt miſerable and abiect villaine, the pooreſt, leaneſt, blindeſt, and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie man that can be imagined: and contrariwiſe, that a modeſt and a vertuous ſimplicitie, is a moſt excellent vertue: and that there is no ſinne that Chriſtians ought more carefully to avoyde, then cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes: and that good men, who live contended with the grace of God, are most happie. And this is declared in the firſt part of this booke.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part, hee ſheweth the remedies againſt covetouſnes, the principall where of is the knowledge and feare of God: conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſetteth downe all the reſt, to the end that every one may conſider of them: as for example; firſt that nature is content with a little: that covetouſnes can not helpe them, who follow it, from the least euill that may be: and that there is no danger ſo great but covetouſnes and riches may bring vs into it: that Avarice was never in eſtimation with any, but with the enemies of knowledge, and vertue: that it draweth after it all confuſion: that wee haue infinite examples of ſuch as haue liberally and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly employed their goods in ſuch ſort as was convenient: that wee muſt firſt ſeeke the kingdome of heaven, and commit the dispoſing of our affaires vnto God: that Covetouſnes is the more deteſtable if we compare it with other vices, which are oppoſite vnto it: and in a word, that there is no contentation of the mind in the loue and liking of worldly riches: then followeth the application of this doctrine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular perſons, and especially vnto Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, he diſcourſeth of the right vſe of riches, and ſheweth the fruits that proceede of charitie and liberalitie towards the poore, by arguments drawne from the nature of God: of the great profit we reape by almes giving: of the aſſured promiſes of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father: of the follie of the covetous man: of the nature of true charitie: of the maledictions and curſes denounced against thoſe, which are not pitifull: of the vnexcuſable crueltie of avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men. And in concluſion anſwereth to the vaine obiections of ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:23951:12"/>as are covetous, who, to excuſe themſelves from beeing liberall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the feare they haue leaſt they ſhould want, and that they haue not ſufficient to giue ſo many almes; and ſo concludeth in the end that to repoſe our truſt in Gods promiſes, is ſufficient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Covetouſneſſe, and to ſettle our mindes in a peaceable and quiet eſtate.</p>

For as we ſee ſome men, which naturally are ſo enclined to miſchiefe, ſo ſeditious, ſo contrary to peace and tranquillity, that they are no ſooner entred into a houſe or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but preſently they ſowe diſcorde and diſſention, troubling the common-quietnes and peaceable eſtate which was before: ſo alſo this curſed deſire is no ſooner entred into our heart, but that forthwith we perceiue a great confuſion of tumultuous and diſſentious appetites to boyle and riſe vp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, which doe ſtraightwaies entangle vs in the nettes and ſnares of the Deuill, and at the length bring vs to miſerable death and deſtruction. He which will diligently conſider the ſtate of an auaritious man, ſhall euidently ſee that he hath no more reſt, then hath the tree that is planted on the toppe of a high hill, which is continually toſſed with the windes: there is no ende nor meaſure of his cares, feare, diſtruſt, deſire and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire all which doe ſo pricke and diſquiet him ſo often as he would ſleepe, that it ſeemeth he lyeth among thornes and bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars. There was neuer ſo cruell a Tyrant as <hi>Couetouſnes:</hi> for ſhe maſſacreth all men with care and trauell, which are vnder her dominion: ſhee haileth and draweth them through fieldes, through woodes, through ſea and land, in winter and ſommer,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:13"/>day and night, wette and dry, without giuing them ſo much as an houre to reſt and repoſe them: ſhe leaueth them naked, or elſe in their ſhirtes with ſome fewe ragges about them, and feedeth them with courſe bread, with dregges, onyons, nuttes, or skallions. And to conclude, if there be any tormented with this paſſion, there is none but will abhorre and deteſt him. Furthermore to ſhewe this her wonderfull crueltie, and that in as liuely and oryent colours as may be: if we haue riches, ſhe leaueth vs but the ſight of them, and taketh away the vſe and pleaſure we ſhould haue of them: ſhe ſhutteth our handes, and ſtoppeth our mouthes, ſo that we may neither taſte, nor touch them: whereupon the <hi>Poets</hi> haue likened a Couetous man to <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who is euen readie to die with hunger and thirſt, though he haue both apples and water iuſt at his mouth; and <hi>Lucian</hi> compareth him to a dogge couched in the hay, who can eate nothing himſelfe, neither yet will ſuffer any other to take thereof, without barking and brawling at them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">Couetouſnes depriueth vs of the vſe of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> ſhe wholly depriueth vs of all the bleſſings of God. For he hath created the world and all that is therein, for the profite, vſe, and benefit of man: ſo that if hauing thoſe his creatures, we doe not vſe them for our neceſſitie, they are vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and can not be called good in reſpect of vs, who receiue no commoditie of them. Which things the auncient <hi>Grecians</hi> did very wel vnderſtand and declare, calling all temporal goods by a word, ſignifying the vſe of things: ſhewing thereby that we may not rightly terme that our good, whereof we make no vſe, or commoditie: by which occaſion <hi>Eſop</hi> (who was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant conceited fellow, and full of wittie deuiſes) ſeeing a man very ſore troubled, for that one had ſtollen away his treaſure which he had hidden in the ground, aduiſed him to take a ſtone of the like quantitie and waight, and to lay that in the ſame place, where before he had hid his treaſour, and withall to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was his money, and all was well ynough: giuing thereby to vnderſtand, that this ſhould ſerue his turne as well as the other, and that ſiluer and gold are not otherwiſe to bee accounted goods, vnleſſe it be of them, who make an vſe of them: as for thoſe who vſe them not, they are onely profitable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23951:13"/>in opinion and conceit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moyſes</hi> alſo, after the deſcription of thoſe things which God had created in the beginning, reciteth that particularly and generally they were good: that is to ſay, well and wiſely ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the commoditie, pleaſure, and profite of men. There is nothing then more contrarie to the ordinance of God, his bountie and deuine wiſdome, then Couetouſnes, which maketh that vnprofitable and vnfruitfull, which God hath created for the vſe and benefite of man.</p>

It may be further ſaid, that if they were lordes of other thinges, as they are of their golde and ſiluer, that notwithſtanding they would be afraide to make any vſe of that which they haue, not conſidering (like vnſenſible creatures) that there is nothing that dureth for euer but onely God, and that according to the lawe and vnevitable neceſſitie, whereby the continuance of all things is determined and appointed, they muſt paſſe away and haue their ende, and are conſumed either by wearing, or by wormes, or by ruſt and rottenneſſe, or at the leaſt by time, which waſteth and conſumeth whatſoeuer eſcapeth or ſaueth it ſelfe from the other deuourers. Seeing then that of neceſſitie they come to an ende one way or other, is it not much more reaſonable that man ſhould make vſe and profite of them, ſeeing it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, who is acknowledged, loued, and honoured by this meanes in the vſe of his creatures, rather then to leaue them to be conſumed of wormes without any commoditie?</p>
               <p>I demand of the Couetous man, how he would like of thoſe ſeruants and hirelings, who by their negligence and careleſnes haue ſuffered his houſes to fall into ruine, and haue left his lands and vineyardes vntilled, or ſeeing ſome man or maide ſeruant in his houſe, which ſerueth him to no purpoſe, how he would be
<pb facs="tcp:23951:14"/>pleaſed with them? why doeth he then make no vſe for the moſt part of his riches and treaſures, but keepe them altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably? why doeth he not thinke alſo that he is the ſeruant of God, holding of him whatſoeuer he hath, with commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make vſe of them, and that he is countable for the dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and loſſe which happeneth by his want of trafficke, that is to ſay, for that he hath not vſed them as the Lorde hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>It is certen that Chriſt Ieſus in the parable of the Talents,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14.</note> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth no other thing, but that whoſoeuer hath receiued any grace or gift of God, of what kinde, qualitie, or price ſo euer it be, if that he doe not ſo employ it as that there may be made ſome profite thereof, ſhalbe puniſhed and caſt into vtter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe of his idleneſſe: yea though he hath kept that which hath bene giuen him ſo well, that it be neither loſt nor diminiſhed, while he had it in his hands.</p>
               <p>And is not this a wonderfull puniſhment,<note n="1" place="margin">Firſt, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe a ſlave to that which ſhould be his ſlaue.</note> that a man ſhould be made a ſlaue vnto that, whereof he ſhould be maſter?

If then we do eſteeme that man to be in miſerable eſtate and condicion, who hauing bene a lord and maſter, is by ſome miſchance become ſubiect to his vaſſaile and ſeruaunt, though he be a man, and by his vertue and wiſedome aduanced to ſome degree: what ſhall we ſay of him, who willingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſelfe a ſlaue, and that to madde and ſenſeleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea, and that which is worſe, to ſinne and to the deuill? For who ſo euer is couetous,<note n="2" place="margin">Secondly he is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</note> is an Idolatour: for that the loue and confidence which he ought to haue in God, hee repoſeth all in the creature, which by this meanes is, as it were, deified by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it in his heart, which is the faireſt and moſt excellent place in all the Temple of God, and the very ſeate which he hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially choſen and reſerued to ſit in, as in his throne, there to dwell continually by his holy ſpirit.

For which cauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> commaunded the Iudges, whome hee had appointed to heare and determine the controverſies of the people, that they ſhould eſpecially take heede of covetouſnes, for that it is the ruine and vtter ſubverſion of Iuſtice.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:23951:15"/>it can not be denied but that they be manquellers, though there were no other reaſon but this, that they will giue nothing vnto their neighbours to relieve and nouriſh them: for even as the fire is extinguiſhed and quenched, not onely by throwing on of water, but alſo by taking away of the wood and other matter whereby it is fedde and nouriſhed: ſo alſo may one deſtroy and take away the life of a man, not onely by offering him violence, but alſo in refuſing to give that vnto him, which is neceſſarie for his preſervation. Moreover, he is very vnthankefull; for who hath beſtowed vpon him all that which he hath? Is it not Chriſt Ieſus, for whoſe ſake God his father hath given them? and this is the very ſame, whoſe members he ſuffereth to periſh with colde and hunger, not vouchſafing to give them bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to nouriſh them, or any courſe and vile ragge to cover them.</p>

For covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hindereth vs from hearing of the worde of God, which is the foundation of our faith, or elſe if we doe heare it to the ende to lay it vp in our heart, it profiteth vs nothing, for that it is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked foorthwith in ſuch ſorte, that it can not ſpring foorth: even as the ſeede that is ſo wen among the thornes.

               <p>If you thinke to feare them with the threatnings which God hath breathed foorth againſt them, who repoſe their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in riches, which are not content with their nouriſhment and cloathing, who helpe not their neighbours, ſhewing vnto them that in ſo doing, they ſhall both looſe them ſelves and the kingdome of heaven: you ſhall not ſee them ſo much mooved, as if they had loſt ſixe pence. Is there then more faithleſſe people then thoſe which diſtruſt the providence of God, which doubt of his promiſes, and haue no feare of his threatnings? and howe ſhould they beleeve in God whome they knowe not? It may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23951:15"/>be they haue ſome ſlight conceit of him which quickely paſſeth away; but this is no true and ſound knowledge: for if they did knowe him as he doeth ſhewe and make manifeſt him ſelfe vnto vs, as he is the fountaine and ſpring of our life, reſt, and quietnes, and that all thinges are vaine, and he alone the ſoveraigne good, which is able to ſatisfie and fill our deſires; would they not leaue all their great and exceſſive cares which they are encombred with in this worlde, for to reſt and repoſe them ſelves wholly in him?</p>

               <p>At ſuch time as in Rome and Lacedemonia povertie was not deſpiſed, and that men were contented onely with neceſſarie things, they were wiſe, conſtant, iuſt, temperate, doing right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all with whome they converſed: and very carefull that in the time of peace the lawes might be publikely obſerved among the Citizens, their children wiſely inſtructed, and all eſtates marſhalled vnder a ſevere and ſtraight diſcipline: in warre, they were vigilant, laborious, patient, couragious, prudent, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and invincible, not onely againſt their enemies, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all calamities and miſeries: yea againſt blowes, ſtripes, and death it ſelfe. But when as thoſe who ſucceeded them (neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the example of their anceſtours) beganne to contemne povertie, and to delight in the glittering ſhewe of wealth and riches, deſiring rather to ſill their cities, their temples and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

And perceiving at length that they had not ſufficient to maintaine ſuch exceſſive charges, in ſtead of acknowledging their faultes, and returning to liue as their predeceſſours had done, they augmented their follies: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had not wherewithall to maintaine their licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, they beganne to prie into the eſtate of their fellowe-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, forging crimes and other ſiniſter meanes, thereby to get that which they had.

<pb facs="tcp:23951:17"/>with gladnes and ſinglenes of heart, praiſing and lauding God for all things: and as concerning their faith, it was ſo great, that they could not be turned from the profeſſion of Chriſt Ieſus, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by threates, nor any torments that were offered them. For millions of them ſuffered martyrdome, and ſatisfied with the efiuſion of their bloode, the crueltie and rage of the Tyrants, which was otherwiſe vnſatiable, who waxed ſooner wearie with murthering, then the Chriſtians with ſuffering. But after the inconſiderate zeale of ſome Princes had increaſed them in wealth and poſſeſſions, preſently (as ſaith <hi>S.

This is often found true by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and that men, after they be once giuen to covetouſnes, haue no regard of honour or any thing elſe. <hi>Timotheus</hi> (as <hi>Elian</hi> reporteth) talking with one, named <hi>Ariſtophon,</hi> ſaid that nothing ſeemed diſhoneſt to a covetous man.</p>
               <p>Many thinke not of this, but they are afraide if they
<pb facs="tcp:23951:23"/>ſhould fall into danger, they ſhould never get out if they were notrich. O the follie and madneſſe of men to thinke (as ſaith the Prophet) that gold and ſilver may deliver them from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.8, 9.</note> when it pleaſeth God to ſend them. Howe many Kings haue fallen into the handes of their enemies with all their treaſures? how many haue beene hanged for all their riches? how many die ordinarily leaving in their coffers plentie of gold &amp; ſilver, which yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not prolong their lives half an houre? what, doe I ſay die? nay how many having but the gout in their little finger, and knowe not howe to attaine any eaſe with all their wealth?</p>
               <p>And riches are ſo farre from preſerving vs from adverſitie,<note place="margin">The third thing is, that viches are ſo farre from helping vs, that often times they draw vs into extreame danger.</note> that ordinarily there is nothing that draweth vs ſooner into it, then they.

It would be an endleſſe ſtorie to gather all the examples of them, whoſe goods haue bene an occaſion of the loſſe of their liues. Princes ſometimes deale with their officers and treaſurers, as we doe with ſponges, which we ſqueaſe with our hands to make them yeild vs that water, which they haue before ſoked vp. ſo alſo after they haue giuen them the meanes to waxe wealthie, and that they haue taken great paine to enrich them ſelues by a little at once, then afore they be aware vpon the ſodaine, they laie holde vpon them, and ſpoile them of that they haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

I muſt needes confeſſe, that in this miſerable worlde, wiſedome and knowledge are as little eſteemed, as they are loued and honoured, and that ſome Clarke in an office, with halfe a dozzen of golde buttons on his jacket, ſhalbe more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured then the moſt vertuous and wiſe man in a whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: but it is not ſufficient to be praiſed; but we muſt alſo note why and wherefore. Firſt, this is moſt plaine, that a man may not be commended, or diſpraiſed for thoſe thinges which are meerely caſuall. For fortune hath no regarde or choiſe in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of her goods, which for the moſt part, ſhe beſtoweth on ſuch as are altogether vnworthie; as we may ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Nabal, Sobna,</hi> and the covetous rich man. Moreover,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.3. Eſay. 22.15.

<pb facs="tcp:23951:24"/>ſurpaſſe them in all theſe, and yet notwithſtanding they are no more capable of praiſe and diſpraiſe, then they be of vice and vertue.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this,<note n="5" place="margin">To keepe vs from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes and prodigalitie, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which make them to be euil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that poſſeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> their muſt be alſo an other conſideration, and that is, howe he which hath riches doth beſtow and diſtribute them. If hee keepe them without helping of his neighbours, hee ſhall be no otherwiſe accounted and eſteemed off, then as a villaine, a miſer, and an vſurer. And if he ſpende them prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallie without any diſcretion or wiſedome, then ſhall hee be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled of flatterers and clawbacks, of fooles, and bauds, which make recourſe vnto him, and cal him Maſter ſo long as his ſilver endureth.</p>
               <p>But as we ſee that flyes will ſtaie no longer in a kitchen, then there is greace to nouriſh them: ſo alſo this goodly companie, which are vſually in the houſes of a prodigal man, as ſoone as his wealth begins to diminiſh, and that he waxeth poore, they will then ſtraightway give him over: yea, if he be euill ſpoken of in their companies, the ſame men, as well as other, will greatlie blame him, for that he hath waſted his goods ſo fooliſhlie: and in a worde, they deale with him as men doe with ſpringes, which ſo long as they yeelde water, ſo long they are haunted, but when they be once drie there is no further reckoning made of them. Marke then who they be that commend theſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall men, braineleſſe perſons, whoſe tongues are as light as their mindes: ſuch as for a morſell of breade, will praiſe or diſpraiſe whome you will.

                  <hi>Crates</hi> compared them to figge trees planted on the top of a mountain, where they bring forth no fruit, but for the crowes: ſo the goods of prodigall men are beſtowed vpon none but flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and ſuch as hunt after other mens tables.

It happened not long after that his creditours ſeeing hee was not able to paie, deſired that (according to the Lawes of the lande) hee might bee laide in priſon: by reaſon whereof his friends were conſtrained to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interceſſours to the King, and to deſire his favour, that in regarde of his former ſervices, it might pleaſe his highneſſe to exempt him from the rigour of the lavves, and that his bodie might not be arreſted: but for all this the King refuſed, ſaying: that willingly hee would haue graunted their requeſtes, if hee, whome they were ſuters for, had expended his goods in the ſervice of his Prince, or defence of his countrie: but ſeeing it vvas for his pleaſures, it was requiſite that his bodie which had committed the fault, ſhould likewiſe beare the ſmarte. VVe may by this conjecture, in what account the prodigall ſort haue beene among all men of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe, who haue riches,<note n="6" place="margin">The ſixt thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is, that hee muſt frame himſelfe to thoſe which haue bin rich &amp; vertuous.</note> and after they haue laide vp ſufficientlie to maintaine their eſtate, doe liberallie diſpende their overplus; wiſelie giving vnto thoſe who haue neede, and are worthie (as did <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iob, Spiridion</hi> a Biſhoppe in <hi>Aſia, Titus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Moecenas, Pomponius Atticus, Cimon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and many others) as they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare, ſo doe they merit eternall praiſe, and their memoriall never to periſh among vertuous men. But all this muſt bee attributed not to their goods, but to their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that hath taught them to vſe them well, and to their vertue, which was the cauſe they haue ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenced them: without the which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> did no otherwiſe eſteeme of a rich man, then of a ſheepe with a golden fleece,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:25"/>or an image curiouſly trimmed and richlie painted with fine gold and bewtifull colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſop</hi> in his fables telleth a tale,<note n="7" place="margin">That wiſe men muſt not hate ſuch as haue not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> that a foxe vpon a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into ones ſhoppe that was a carver of Images, taking vp a manshead, that was excellently wrought in Ivorie, after he had diligently conſidered the workemanſhippe both without and within, as though he had purpoſed to haue bought it, ſaid in the end with great admiration: O bewtifull head howe excellentlie art thou made? and yet thou lackeſt the principall thing, for thouhaſt no witte. The like we may ſay to all rich men, that are evill brought vp: they be gallantly apparelled, wel lodged, rich, &amp; haue great ſtore of horſe, &amp; men to wait of them, and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſt, ſo little wit, that they would not ſuffer the leaſt ſervant they haue in their houſes, if he were like them ſelves. Wherein they plainlie ſhew what account they make of them ſelves. It is then great follie to purchaſe riches, thinking thereby to liue in greater honour among men, for as we haue ſaid before, as true felicitie dependeth of vertue, ſo doth alſo the praiſe and commendation of it.</p>
               <p>There are others,<note n="8" place="margin">That firſt we must ſeeke the kingdome of God, &amp; leaue all things elſe to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> who thinke their Covetouſnes may be the better excuſed in ſaying, they gather for their children, to the ende, that after their death they may haue ſomewhat to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as though they had leſſe wit then the bruit beaſts, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left at their libertie, find ſufficient where with all to nouriſh themſelves. But if they be ſo carefull for their children (ſeeing that life is miſerable, if it be not vertuous and good) why are they not as carefull of their good education, to the end they may live well, as they are painfull to provide for them that they may live eaſilie? for if they liue vertuouſlie, their life is devine and angelicall, but if they liue idelie, in libertie, and care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their eaſe,<note place="margin">

Furthermore (if as Chriſt ſaide) it be a bleſſed thing to giue, rather then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, why doe they not rather teach them to giue of their goods which they leaue them vnto the poore, then to keepe and augment them?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</note> God in commending Abraham as a good father of his familie, ſaith not, that he taught his children to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the pence hee left them into teſters, nor the teſters into crownes, but to walke in the waies of the Lord, and to doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

Demaund of the rich men, whether if they thought that their children would ſpend their goods which they leaue them, in ſportes and playes, and in ſuch like prodigall maner, they would ſo macerate and torment their minds and bodies to gather them as they do?

By this we may gather whether fathers haue ſo great reaſon ſo greedily to gather wealth for their children, and to leaue their heire ſuch abundance: and whether on the one ſide their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be much bound vnto them, for that they receiued their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily liues of them,<note place="margin">Laertius li. 6.

               <p>But there is one thing which is common to all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 10 <hi>thing and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall that there is no contentment in the goods of this world.</hi>
                  </note> and that is, that they hope, (having attained that which they deſire) they ſhall liue at their eaſe, and with contentment, wherein they are deceiued: for when they thinke they haue gotten great reſt, they find they haue gotten as many ſorowes as they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten crownes: and they finde by experience that which is truly ſaid of the Philoſopher <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that nothing may ſuffice them.</p>
               <p>They may well fill their coffers, their boxes, and their purſes, but they ſhall neuer ſatisfie their owne deſire which is vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It neuer regardeth that which it hath, and therewith to bee contented: but it alwayes coveteth that which it hath not, that it may be the more tormented. It is like to a fire, which if it be not quickly quenched burneth on euerie ſide, encreaſing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie according to the quantitie of the matter wherewith it is nouriſhed. Or like vnto a flood, which at the beginning being but a little riuer, by little and little, (as it runneth) encreaſeth in ſuch ſort, that in the end it beareth with it whatſoeuer reſiſteth. If a couetous man haue once gotten a hundred crownes, hee ſtraightwaies deſireth two hundred, from two hundred hee commeth to a thouſand, from a thouſand to a million, and from millions to an infinite ſumme. They are like vnto them that clime vp a ladder, who vſe the firſt ſteppe as a meanes to come to the ſecond, and the ſecond to come to the third, continually climing vntill they come to the toppe. And there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, but that the one findeth an end of their ladder, the other findeth none at all, neither of his care and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which neceſſarily follow riches, neither yet of his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires in the attaining and keeping of them. O poore man (ſaith <hi>Saint Baſil</hi> lamenting the miſerable eſtare of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous) which takeſt no pity of thy ſelfe, ſeeing thon endureſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23951:26"/>ſo much for the goods thou haſt,<note place="margin">In his ſermon againſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</note> and ſo much or more for thoſe thou deſireſt and couereſt. Theſe are not the fruites which the earth yeeldeth, but the ſorowes, griefes, and vexations which thine owne intemperate humour procureth. This is nothing but the torment and trauell of thy minde, thou complaineſt continually, and ſaieſt, what ſhall I doe? thy ſorrowes ſhewe thy miſchiefe, and thy deſire the meanes which bringeth thereto. Thy deſire promiſeth thee ioy and quietneſſe, and in the ende bringeth nothing but griefe and ſadneſſe. O cruell and ſtrange paſſion, and little differing from madneſſe: for a madde man deſireth nothing ſo much as water, by reaſon of his ſtrange alteration: and there is nothing which doeth more torment him: for the ſight thereof is ſufficient to vexe and trouble him. Who is there then that conſidering theſe things will not commend <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaying? that a man ſhall neuer be ſo well pleaſed with his deſire, as if hee would not deſire at all. God alſo in his lawe ſetting downe the manner of a happie life, prohibiteth vs to deſire any thing that is our neighbours, that is to ſay, nothing but what it ſhall pleaſe him to beſtow vpon vs for our maintenance: and whoſoeuer after this ſort ſeeketh to ſatisfie himſelfe, attaineth vnto his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſaide, that hauing a little rice pottage he woulde diſpute with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and maintaine that hee was as happie as he.</p>
               <p>Euerie man may now euidently perceiue whether the couetous ſort haue any great reaſon to maintaine that which they doe, and to excuſe themſelues,<note place="margin">In the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that which hath bin ſpoken to particular perſons, hee ſheweth that euerie man ought to ſhun covetouſneſſe but especially Kings and great ſtates.</note> and to couer their immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſires, which all men ought to feare as a fire, and to flie from as a plague, eſpecially Kings, Princes, and great Lordes, for that they are more odious in them, then in the common ſort, and they bring foorth greater miſchiefes then any thing elſe whatſoeuer. For as they are great, ſo are alſo their deſires great, and ſmall matters will not ſuffice them. They ſeeke not after a farme, a meddowe, or a mill, but aftercaſtles, barronies, and counties, and hauing authoritie equall with their deſire it is a difficult matter to reſiſt them, and that in contenting them, there be not many impoueriſhed, ſome by calumnious &amp; ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous accuſations, others by falſe compacts &amp; vniuſt donations,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:27"/>and the greater part by open violence and tyrannie. And to ſpeake briefely, it muſt needes fall out, that if the treaſure of the Prince encreaſeth, the wealth of the ſubiects diminiſheth: and it commeth to paſſe (as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour ſaid) as it doeth with the ſplene in a mans bodie, which can not encreaſe or waxe greater, but the other members muſt needes decreaſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſſer.

But this is conrrary, for the intereſt is farre greater then the principall: for we receiue a hundred for one, and for a pot of water, the kingdome of heauen, and life euerlaſting, which is ineſtimable and can not be valued. We are not afraid to caſt our ſeed into the earth, and, as it were, to lend it to the ground vpon vſury: which thing we doe with a great deſire and very carefully, being the bolder for the hope of the commodity we reape thereby, although it be doubtfull, and that by reaſon of ſundry caſualties, we may be deceiued: why then ſhoulde wee feare to giue our goods vnto our God, hauing his promiſe for our aſſurance, and withall life euerlaſting? If he be readie and willing to giue, is it poſſible he ſhould be ſlow to reſtore? and if without our induſtry and paines he maketh vs rich, by his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodneſſe, is it likely that beeing bound vnto vs by his word, he will ſuffer vs to remaine in pouertie?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ocrates on a time hearing Alcibiades make great brags of his worldly poſſeſſions, deſired him to walke with him into a gallery in the citie of Athens, wherein there was a Map contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the deſcription of the whole earth. Whither when they were come, Socrates requeſted him to finde out Attica, which when Alcibiades had done, Socrates deſired him likewiſe to ſhewe him his lands and poſſeſſions: whereto Alcibiades anſwered, that there was nomenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: why then (ſaid Socrates) doeſt thou vaunt of that, which maketh ſo ſmall a ſhew? We may ſay the like vnto the Ambitious ſort, and ſuch as conceiue a great opinion of themſelues, that they ſhoulde ſhew vs where they were a hundreth yeeres agoe, and where they ſhall be a hundred yeeres hence: And to what ende theſe vanities ſerue them that make them ſo preſumptuous? But becauſe that in this booke following they ſhall find their proceſſe ready drawne, if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not, it is not convenient that we ſhould in this place make any long diſcourſe thereof. But let vs conſider the order of the authour, and the principal parts of his diſcourſe. Having then in the beginning ſhewed what ambition is, and the diverſitie thereof, he forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the particular effects of this diſeaſe, which principally are in number ſeven, beeing accompanied with many and notable examples gathered out of ſundry hiſtories: which beeing done, hee entreth into the diſcourſe of the knowledge of our ſelues, which is the firſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die againſt Ambition, vpon which occaſion hee entreateth of the miſerie of man ſince ſin came into the world, which is the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him without the grace of God: In like maner of the miſchiefes which spring of pride, &amp; why the good &amp; vertuous men are ſo many wayes humbled, while they line in this world, where in the mean while they
<pb facs="tcp:23951:31"/>daily receiue new gifts and preſents: contrariwiſe the proud are spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of ſuch things as the ſufferance of God hath permitted them to enioy. For that in ſtead of giuing glory to God, they rob him of it, and with great vngratefulneſſe and vntollerable oſtentation, attribute it to themſelues: not conſidering, that if they will be vertuous they muſt neuer be ouercome of ambition, but alwaies be ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe their owne weakeneſſe: whereto the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth vs, condemning all vaine glorie, which good men haue alwaies deteſted and abhorred, knowing that pride corrupteth good workes: which proceedeth of nothing, but of want of knowledge of our owne ſelues, and of the grace of God. Which thing is verified by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an excellent doctor, and a most notable inſtruction how to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe being finiſhed, he propoundeth a ſecond reaſon, full of force &amp; efficacie: that is to ſay, the example of the Sonne of God, who being Lord of men and angels, notwithstanding during his abode here vpon earth, was a perfit example of humility, and of the contempt of worldly glory. To this are added ſundry examples of the moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; famous men that euer were. Then enſueth the third remedie, which conſiſteth in the conſideration of the manifold dangers which accompany prosperitie: in which diſcourſe true &amp; feyned humility are liuely deſcribed. And laſt of all is declared how we ſhall attaine to the knowledge of our ſelues, and by conſequent to true humility, which is a mortall enemie to ambition. And this is by reading and diligent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the holy ſcripture, by comparing our eſtate with other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by a due examination of our ſelues, &amp; of our actions: by a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that which we haue not, in compariſon of that we haue, by comparing our condition wherein we now are, with that wherein our father Adamliued before his fall: regarding who they are that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vs or dispraiſe vs: And in concluſion, a liuely apprehenſion of the iudiciall ſeat of God, to the end that by the example of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections heretofore, we may learne to ſeeke the quiet of the mind in the humilitie of the heart, remembring what the moſt excellent devines haue written, how that nothing is ſo highly exalted as true humilitie, and that as the tree which we deſire ſhould increaſe &amp; grow in height, must take deepe rooting in the earth, ſo he which hath not his minde firſt of all ſurely rooted in true humilitie, the higher he lifteth vp him ſelfe, the nearer he approcheth to his owne deſtruction.</p>

This deſire is not in al alike,<note place="margin">Ambition greater in ſome them in other ſome.</note> but is in greater meaſure in one then in another, according to the diuerſitie of their humours and affections. For thoſe who haue excellent wits and hautie courages, readie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and take in hand great matters, are moſt ſubiect to this paſſion.

The like appeareth in the wood, which the more fine and excellent it is, the more it is ſubiect to the worme and to corruption.

And we care not oftentimes, whether we be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted offor vertue or for vice, among wiſe men or fooles, for good workes or for bad. For the immoderate deſire of glorie is alwayes naught, and when as to ſatisfie this affection we take naughtie matters in hand, then is it worſt of all.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23951:36"/>asked them if they thought there was ſo happie a man in all Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as him ſelfe, and whether he wanted any thing that might make him more fortunate: whereto one of the company wiſely anſwered, that the principall thing was yet wanting, that is to ſay, Modeſtie and Humilitie to keepe him in the favour of God, without the which there is no true happineſſe; and that the wrath and iudgement of God could not be farre from him and his houſe, conſidering his preſumptuous and proude minde: which thing this wretched man not long after by wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence prooved to be true. For ſuch as by his means had bin bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the citie, ſecretly returning in a night, tooke him, his wife, &amp; children, put them in priſon, and there moſt cruelly ſterved them to death in the ſight of all the people, being wonderfully aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and moved with compaſſion at ſo ſtrange an alteration.</p>

This is a manner of ſpeach by the which he giveth vs to vnderſtand, that all thoſe, who glorie in their greatneſſe, their nobleneſſe, their ſtrength, and their riches, ſhall at length be throwen downe with the wrath of God, which ſhall fall vpon them as a thunderclappe. God ſpeaking to the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> and foretelling them by his Prophet <hi>Abdias,</hi> the plagues he had provided to puniſh and abate their pride, ſaith, I will make thee contemptible to all nations: the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, nowe that thou art in the ſtrong holdes which thou haſt builded in the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe inexpugnable, and that no man can come at thee, and ſayeſt, Who can pull me from hence?

               <p>There are many other threatnings of God in the Scripture againſt the proud,<note n="7" place="margin">The proude man never remembreth his owne eſtate.</note> but even as this curſed ambition doth ſo blind vs, that we can not perceive the miſchiefes that proceed thereof, nor the dangers wherein it plungeth vs, ſo alſo doeth it ſtop our eares againſt all the words &amp; reproofs which God vſeth, &amp; that which is more, it bereaveth vs of all knowledge &amp; feeling of our owne ſelves. For what man is there that hath wel conſidered his own eſtate, that ever gloried &amp; bragged therof? It is to be thought that if theſe hauty &amp; proud minded perſons, which take ſo great pleaſure &amp; contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in them ſelves, would but a litle conſider
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23951:37"/>their owne eſtate, and the imperfections and vices of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the ignorance, the luſt, the feare, the diſtruſt, the ſorrowe and diſcontentment of our minds: and on the otherſide, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, the diſeaſes, the weakenes, the age and death which wee are ſubiect to, by reaſon of ſinne; Is it likely they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that this proceeded from the ſlaverie of ſinne, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, of the anger and diſpleaſure of God, of the loſſe of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage whereunto we were created, of the contradiction of the fleſh to his ſpirite: and in a worde, of that wonderfull diſorder, which is in our hearts and vnderſtandings?</p>
               <p>The ancient Philoſophers exhorted men alwaies to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ends, thinking that the remembrance thereof,<note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelfe, and of true humility</note> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to humble them, and to make them carefull to doe well: and in deede the proudeſt, with the conſideration thereof are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, having opened <hi>Cyrus</hi> tombe, and finding his bones mouldie and halfe conſumed, conſidering the fragilitie and inconſtancie of all humane things, wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly; ſo did <hi>Xerxes,</hi> beholding his armie from the top of an hill, for that within 100. yeeres after, both hee and they ſhould be forgotten. <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedonie being fallen into a ſandepit, and conſidering after he was out, the meaſure of his body which was there imprinted, deteſted the ambition and deſire of men, who coveted ſo much, themſelves in length and breadth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſo little.</p>
               <p>Nowe if the bare conſideration of our ende, is of ſuch great force to abate our pride, howe availeable is it to conſider, what God hath done to our firſt parents, as alſo to remember what we are, and from whence we come?<note place="margin">Gen. 5.19.</note> Thou art duſt (ſaith God) out of the earth thou waſt taken, and to the earth thou ſhalt returne. So our beginning, our being, and our end is al earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

               </p>
               <p>It may be that ſome, (the better to defend mans excellencie, and to proove that hee may iuſtlie preferre him ſelfe before all other creatures of the world) will ſay: that though our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be earthly, yet our ſoules are heavenly, and doe in ſome ſort participate of the glorie of God. This may be eaſilie graunted,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:38"/>if we conſider the eſtate wherein man firſt was created: and that if hee had continued in the integritie and perfection, wherewith God had ennobled and honoured him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, hee might then iuſtlie haue accounted himſelfe the moſt excellent, and as it were, the Prince of all other creatures. But beeing ſo imperfect as we are, I knowe not howe wee can without bluſhing, acknowledge our Creator. VVhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted, wee may not boaſt, that in reſpect of our nature, wee are any wayes more excellent then the bruite beaſtes, if without affection wee will rightly wey the trueth, and that, as reaſon and experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs.</p>
               <p>Nay wee muſt needes confeſſe,<note place="margin">The beaſtes are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then man, as hee is left in his corruption.</note> that they ſurpaſſe vs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things: as the Dove in ſimplicitie, the emmate in induſtrie, the ſtorke in humanitie, the dogge in love and fidelitie, the oxe and the aſſe in memorie, the lambe in meekeneſſe, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in magnanimitie, the cocke in vigilancie, the ſerpent in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, and all in generall, in contentment and ſobrietie. And as the beaſtes are more excellent then man in naturall goodneſſe and vertue,<note place="margin">Man excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the beaſtes in mallice &amp; corruption.</note> ſo doeth hee exceede them in mallice and corruption. For hee is more cruell and more treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then the woolfe, more craftie then the foxe, prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the peacocke, more voluptuous and vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then the ſwine, and more daungerous then the aſpe. Moreover, thoſe evills (I vſe this word, for fault of a better) that are in divers beaſtes, and that naturallie are inherent in them, vvithout any deliberation or election, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; fully complete in one man, who endevoureth by all means poſſible, to poſſeſſe them in their higheſt degree. And yet wee bragge and boaſt of our vnderſtanding, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together blindeneſſe, and of our libertie or rather of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, and want of freewill: of our eyes ſo loftely placed in our heads, to diſcerne afarre off, &amp; greedilie to looke after the vanities of this world: of our tongues, which ſerve vs to lie, to ſlaunder, and blaſpheme: of our hands, which are inſtruments to fight, and to filch: of our feete, which are ſwift to doe evill, and in a worde, of all the parts of our bodies, which (as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith) ſeeme to be the wages of iniquitie, and to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23951:38"/>worke it with greedineſſe.</p>
               <p>God forbid, notwithſtanding that this which I haue ſaid,<note place="margin">God is not the author of this evill, but the deuil and man.</note> ſhould any waies ſound to the diſhonour of the Creator, who (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moſt notablie declareth, and likewiſe <hi>Galen)</hi> hath with excellent skill, and ſingular cunning, framed and fitted every part of this our building. But the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſumptuous this building is, the more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table are the ruines, and wee the more blameable, who haue ſo miſerablie ruinated them, vſing them for that vile ſervice of ſinne and concupiſcence, which haue beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs for the honour of God, and exerciſe of vertue. The lewes ſeeing the ruines of their Temple, curſed the Gentiles, who had ſo prophaned that holy place; the name of <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> likewiſe was moſt odious to the Grecians, for that hee had ſet Dianaes temple in Epheſus on fire, through an execrable deſire he had to eternize his name. Howe greatly then ought wee to be diſpleaſed with our ſelves, which haue polluted the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie of our God, and ſpoiled it of all thoſe precious veſſels which were in it, to dedicate them to the ſervice of the devil, the world, and of ſinne.</p>
               <p>If then, that the Image of God appeared in vs by the light of our mindes, and by the ſinceritie of our affections, wee ſhould have ſome occaſion to glorie in him: nowe that thorough our fault it is defaced, or at the leaſt obſcured, ſo that wee may hardly finde out the traces thereof, have wee not as great, yea greater cauſe, to humble our ſelves; ſeeing that in the place thereof, the image of the devill ſucceedeth, who beeing a murtherer, and the father of lies, hath nothing in this worlde more like him ſelfe then man, who naturallie is cruell, proude, and a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake truely, there is nothing but the grace of God,<note place="margin">Man is damned without the ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God.</note> that maketh vs differ from him. For of our ſelves (as ſaith <hi>Saint Augustine)</hi> wee are verie deuills: and if ſo bee that after <hi>Adam</hi> had tranſgreſſed the commaundement of GOD, God had left him without promiſe. If CHRIST IESVS his Sonne, to raiſe him vp againe, would not haue taken his nature vpon him, the poore man
<pb facs="tcp:23951:39"/>with all his poſteritie ſhould haue bene without all hope, like vnto the Devils. Seeing then, that all the felicitic and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that we haue aboue the devils, is compriſed in hope, and hope is founded in the promiſes, and the mere favour of God; if this were taken from vs, what ſhould we haue to glorie of, more then they? contrariwiſe they ſhould haue great advantage over vs; for they ſhould be our lords, and ſhould ſurmount vs in many things, as in quicknes of ſpirit, in knowledge of arts, in ſtrength, in agilitie, and that they are of an immortall and impaſſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I demand then, if man, beeing thus deſtitute of the gifts of God, hath any thing whereof he may boaſt: and if for this his vaineglorie, he be not worthie great hatred, and that that angels, and other creatures ſhould agree to reproove him of his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie? what ſhould we ſay, if a beggar, which hath not a ragge to cover him, will notwithſtanding bragge that he is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt man, and the richeſt of all the countrey, and in all aſſemblies whereſoeuer, is not aſhamed to take the hieſt place? would not euery man iudge ſuch a fellow worthie to be whipt? likewiſe if there were a thiefe, who being convicted of many great crimes, notwithſtanding would be ſo ſhameleſſe, and ſo ſtately, that he would not humble himſelfe before his iudge, nor any other man, doth not he deſerve without any pitie, to be puniſhed with all ſeveritie? If man in like manner, diſſembling his beggerly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, his vice and ignorance, will preſume that he is wiſe, rich, and vertuous, doeth hee not by this meanes make himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of Gods mercie, whereof he ſhould participate, if by an humble confeſſion of his miſerie, hee would ſeeke for it. VVee haue a moſt memorable example of this,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.10.</note> in the <hi>Phareſie</hi> and the <hi>Publican:</hi> the one of them beeing more iuſt and more pleaſing in the ſight of God with confeſſing his ſinne, then the other boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his righteouſnes.<note place="margin">In his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> For man (as ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin)</hi> by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie maketh God to forget his ſinne, and cauſeth him by his preſumption, to forget all his vertues and good deedes. Though to ſpeake properly where there is no humilitie, there is no faith, and where there is no faith, there is no good works.</p>
               <p>Behold the profit we haue of our pride: which is, that firſt of all we kindle the anger of God againſt vs: it taketh away from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23951:39"/>vs the hope of forgivenes, which we might purchaſe through his mercie. Secondly, it bereaveth vs of faith, with all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Chriſt Ieſus. For the ſpirit of God which inſpireth our hearts, and which maketh vs to taſte the ſweetnes of his Goſpel, is not given but to the humble: theſe are thoſe whom God fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with good things, as ſaith the Virgin Marie, in her ſong.<note place="margin">Luk. 1.53.</note> Chriſt Ieſus attributed the infidelitie of the Iewes to nothing ſo much, as to their preſumption.<note place="margin">Iohn 5.44.</note> How can you beleeve in me (ſaith he) which receiue honour one of another, and ſeeke not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which commeth of God alone? this is alſo the cauſe that (correcting the ambition of his Diſciples) hee ſet before them a little infant and ſaid vnto them,<note place="margin">Math. 18.3.</note> that if in modeſtie and ſimplicitie of heart, they would not reſemble that litle infant, they ſhould not enter into the kingdome of God. For God (the better to declare the greatnes of his wiſdome) doeth all his workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opinion and iudgement of men. By fooliſhneſſe hee confoundeth the counſell, and the wiſedome of the worlde: by weakenes he breaketh their force: by contempt he obſcureth their glorie: by death hee raiſeth vp, and turneth curſing into bleſſing: ſo alſo by the croſſe and by humilitie, hee hath lifted vp Chriſt Ieſus into his glorie, and after him by the ſame meanes exalteth all his members. The devill contrariwiſe, by honours, pleaſures, riches, and idlenes, doth throwe downe headelong all ſuch as are his.</p>
               <p>But what is the reaſon, that after that he hath adopted vs,<note place="margin">God doth leave his children a ſpace here vpon the earth in their infirmities, to humble them and to make them more fit for the participation of his grace in heaven.</note> and regenerated vs for his children, he leaveth vs ſtill in the worlde vntill we die, ſeeing that we now are burgeſſes of heaven, and as it were, his domeſticall ſervants: and therefore our mindes, our heartes, and all our cogitations and affections, ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly? why will hee that our bodies ſhould be more converſant here, then our hearts? is it not becauſe hee would haue vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies contemplate, and remember the earth from whence wee were taken, that by this means we may be humbled, and he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, who hath taken vs out of the mire, and lifted vs vp to the heavens, where by hope he hath placed vs in honour with his Sonne, his angels, and the Patriarkes? Why alſo is it his pleaſure that we ſhould live here alwaies vnder a hard and ſevere diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and that we ſhould be continually exerciſed by povertie,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:40"/>diſeaſes, warres, impriſonments and baniſhments, and ſuch like afflictions, which give vs no more libertie then ſevere maſters doe their ſchollers? Is this the abundance of reſt and quietnes which was promiſed, and that we ſhall finde in his kingdome? we may eaſilie ſee, that all this is done by the wiſe counſell of our God, who by this meanes keepeth vs in humilitie, and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that by the enioying of our goods (if peradventure he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth vs any before we knowe how to rule them) we ſhould not giue our ſelves to all filthines. For the ſame purpoſe he willeth, that, after we be ſanctified and received into his Church, we are not wholly exempted from ſinne, but hath left our fleſh with the luſts thereof, which ceaſe not to trouble and moleſt our mindes, to this end, that we continually feeling our infirmities and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſhould haue alwaies ſomewhat to humble vs, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the naturall pride of our hearts. We ſee then that God by all meanes procureth our health, and provideth that we ſhould not by a vaine confidence, and preſumption of our vertues, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his graces which are not given but to the final, and to ſuch as are lowly minded.</p>
               <p>We ſee (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> that vſually the vallies are more fertile then the hils,<note place="margin">The graces of God fal vpon the humble.</note> for that the fatnes of the earth is more eaſily caried thither by raines and ſhowers: ſo muſt it be with vs, if we will be filled with the graces and benedictions of our God, wee muſt be lowe and plaine as the vallies. And further, that having received them, we be not more vngratefull, then is the good earth, which multiplieth the ſeede which it hath received, and doth truely repay the fruits thereof vnto the maſter. If we have received one tallent, let vs ſo demeane our ſelves, that we make two thereof, and that two may encreaſe to fowre, and then let vs give all the glorie to God, that is to ſay; firſt of the good, then of the will and induſtrie, whereby wee haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it. Thirdly, for the proſperitie and ſucceſſe, which hee hath given it: and laſtly, of the reward and crowne which wee looke for. For otherwiſe, wee may aſſure our ſelves, hee will withdraw his grace, and the proſperitie which he hath given vs, if wee be vnthankfull, or careleſſe to acknowledge him, and to give him the glorie of whatſoeuer is good and commendable in our ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> ſaith, that God,<note place="margin">Our pride maketh God to take away thoſe graces he hath giuen vs and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them vpon others.</note> by reaſon of the great lone he beareth vs, is content as it were to traffick with vs, and to mingle his goods with our euils.

<pb facs="tcp:23951:41"/>glorie which we haue robbed God of? good God, what riches have we gotten whereof we may bragge? was not our father (as ſaith the Prophet) an <hi>Amorrhit,</hi> and our mother an <hi>Hethite?</hi> the inheritance they haue left vs, was it not ſinne, male diction, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and death? and what friends haue they alſo gotten vs, but our fleſh with her luſts, and the world with his pleaſures? If God then would diſpute with the ambitious, and demaunde of him, why he doth ſo much glorie in him ſelfe: what anſwer would he make, wherby it ſhould appeare he had not plaied the thiefe? if as (<hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith) all honour appertaineth to him,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.17</note> it muſt needs be, that ſo often as we glorie and boaſt of our ſelues, we neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily inferre one of theſe two thinges: either that wee woulde make our ſelues equall with him, or elſe robbe and ſteale from him like thiefes, that which may in no wiſe be alienated from his crowne and dignitie. For as concerning his vertues, he may communicate them with others: he imparteth of his wiſedome to his Prophets, and miniſters of his Church: of his might and authoritie to Princes: of his iuſtice, to Iudges: and to all ſuch as are friendly and charitable, of his mercie and bountie. But this is with a reſervation of all the glorie due vnto ſuch vertues, whereof the creature whatſoever he be, may in no wiſe partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate.</p>
               <p>Let not the wiſe man (ſaith he,<note place="margin">

We muſt then if we will obey the commandement of God, ſing with the Prophet David: Lord, thou art my glorie, and my honour. For there is nothing in vs, whereof we ſhould make eſtimate, but onely this, that we are in the nomber of thoſe, who call vpon his name, and ſuch as by his mercie haue hope and part of his kingdome. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all glorie and honout (ſaith S. Paul) to be dongue.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> And Salomon ſaith: That I have diligently conſidered all things that men doe admire, and for the which they would be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and eſteemed in this world, and haue ſeene in the ende they are but vanitie, and that none but fooles doe buſie them ſelves about them.</p>
               <p>This is a ſtrange thing, that time, which is ſo wiſe, and which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23951:41"/>revealeth all things, nor experience cannot perceiue this, and that our iudgement is ſo corrupted, that we ſearch not for honor but in vaine things, as in banquets, buildings, in goodly moueables, apparell, horſe and great traines, and ſuch like mockeries of fortune. If wee would ſeeke honour by vertue, our ambition were more tollerable, but wee haue no reaſon to deſire ſo much honour, and to make ſo ſmall account of things that deſerue better.</p>
               <p>And yet my meaning is not, that if wee haue any good thing in vs, that wee ſhould bee proud of it. For we alwayes ought to giue the glory vnto God, and to yeeld him all the praiſe: as wee ſee that veſſels of gold and ſiluer, receiuing the light of the beames of the ſunne, yeeld as it were part thereof backe againe by reflection: ſo muſt we, if we thinke we haue done any thing which is good, confeſſe (with <hi>Saint Paul)</hi> that it is not wee, but the grace of God which is in vs. If a man graffe in his garden, or orchard, and atwo or three yeres after his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener bring him of the fruit, ſaying, this of the tree he graffed, he reioyceth therein: ſo God taketh great pleaſure, if we, hauing any good in vs, yeeld him the praiſe thereof. For this is no ſmall honour vnto him to haue ſo well husbanded vs, that beeing fruiteleſſe and barren grounde, and as it were olde ſtockes dead and rotten, now by his meanes wee ſhoulde bring foorth good fruite. And it is out of doubt, that in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs fructifie and proſper, hee taketh greater pleaſure then doeth the husbandman, when his corne proſpereth on the earth: eſpecially if in acknowledging our fertilitie wee freely confeſſe, that it proceedeth not of our nature and induſtrie. and what can we doe leſſe? for it is as if a creditour, to whome wee are indebted as much as wee haue, ſhould require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of vs, but a bare acknowledgement of the debt wee owe him. ſhoulde this grieue vs? there is nothing that the people of Iſrael were ſo reprooued for, nor wherewith God was more grieued, then with their ingratitude, and that they had forgotten, or elſe diſſimuled the good they had receiued of him?

Contrariwiſe there was nothing more commended in the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> then her humilitie, whereby ſhee acknowledging her ſelfe vnworthie of thoſe great graces that God had beſtowed vpon her, hath in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table long teſtified vnto all the worlde, that the onely thing that mooued God to reſpect her humilitie, in chooſing her to be the mother and nource of his Sonne, was his grace and bountie.</p>
               <p>Let vs follow then his example,<note place="margin">That we muſt eſchew ingra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces common to al the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſorte, which are here ſet down by foure fitte ſimilitudes.</note> and not be like vnto young coltes, which being become great, doe as well kicke and ſtrike their dames, who haue brought them foorth and nouriſhed them, as other horſes. This was in former time obiected to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by reaſon of his ingratitude towards his maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> detracting from him whatſoeuer hee might both in his bookes and readings, not acknowledging that the moſt excellent part of his knowledge was taken from him. But this is much more beſeeming vs, ſeeing that the goods and graces which God hath beſtowed vpon vs, are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and that wee haue nothing, but that we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him: if then we diſſemble the place from whence they come, and conceale his name, who hath ſo liberally dealt with vs,<note place="margin">The firſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</note> and attribute all whollie to our ſelues, were we not exceedingly to be blamed? As the ſunne being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ouer vs, our bodies haue the leſſe ſhadowe, as wee may perceiue at noone, and a little before or after: ſo alſo the more vertue and goodneſſe is in vs, the leſſe oſtentation ſhould we haue. Contrariwiſe, as this is a ſigne of the going downe of the ſunne and his departure from vs, when as our ſhadowes become great: ſo alſo this is an argument to prooue that vertue diminiſheth in vs, when pride and preſumption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth. The veſſels that are fulleſt make leaſt noiſe, and we iudge them emptie or elſe that there is little in them, when as being touched they make any great noiſe or ſound: ſo alſo there is nothing that more manifeſteth the wants of vertue, then bragging and boaſting. When as the eares of corne bend downe their heads, the husbandmen reioyce: for this ſheweth they are laden, and that they haue plentie of graine: ſo alſo we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23951:43"/>may coniecture that thoſe men are well furniſhed with vertue, and vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> when they are modeſt in worde and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The pedlars, who haue nothing but their packes, ſhewe forthwith all their wares: but contrariwiſe, the great marchants keepe only litle bagges in their ſhops of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular marchandiſe, the better to ſhew what ſtore they haue in their ware houſes. The like we may ſee among men, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily thoſe who make the greateſt ſhewe, haue the leaſt in deede, and that none are more ambitious and deſirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, then thoſe who leaſt deſerue it. For wiſe men (as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaith) repoſe their felicitie not in the opinion and praiſes of men, but in doing ſuch things as deſerue it. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fooles doe little eſteeme of vertue in deed and the effects thereof, ſo that they may be reputed vertuous: and contrarie to the counſell of <hi>Socrates,</hi> they rather deſire to ſeeme to be, then to be indeed. Which is a ſtrange thing, for it is as if they deſired the name rather of a king, then the authoritie, power, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a prince: or to ſpeake more properly: It is as though they deſired to be accounted healthſome, and yet care not for health at all.</p>
               <p>We muſt then, if we will be accounted vertuous in deede,<note place="margin">If we will be vertuous we muſt not bee ambitious.</note> purge and clenſe our hearts of all ambition, euen as to fill a veſſell full of good liquor, wee muſt firſt ſtoppe out the winde. There is nothing (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſayeth) that ſo much ſhutteth out vertue, and hindereth the entrance thereof into our mindes, as when we are full of vaine glory. And this is that which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> teacheth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that to be wiſe, they muſt become fooles:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.18.</note> which is not ſpoken darkely as it ſeemeth to be at the firſt ſight, but to humble thoſe among them, who were puffed vp with a vaine perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their wiſdome, and to ſhew vnto them, that ſo long as they helde this falſe opinion of themſelues, they were not capable of the holy ghoſt, neither of the true knowledge of God: that is to ſay, of his ſecrets which haue alwaies bene hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the great ones, and are not reuealed, but to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> in auncient time, was by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23951:44"/>accounted the wiſeſt man of all Greece in that he ſaid he knew nothing, and indeede it is no ſmall knowledge, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ignorance: ſo alſo it is not one of the ſmalleſt vertues in vs, to acknowledge our faults and imperfections. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a thing (as ſaith the ſame <hi>Gregorie)</hi> taketh away and cutteth off the greateſt parte of the thing indeede: that is, man is ſo much the more fooliſh as hee thinketh himſelfe wiſe. Wee muſt then make a generall rule of that which <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> ſaieth,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.3.</note> ſpeaking of almes giuing, that the left hande ſhoulde not knowe what the right hande doeth: and ſtretch this ſpeach to other kindes of vertues which may be in vs, and generally to all ſortes of good workes, which wee doe, which wee ought not onely to diſſemble, but alſo to be ignorant of and to forget them when they are done, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelues with this, that God knoweth them, and hath written them in his booke, to the end to keep them in perpetual memory, and to recompence them at the latter day, when hee ſhall examine the doings of men and angels.</p>
               <p>Why are we compared in the ſcriptures to ſheepe rather then to lions or horſes,<note place="margin">The words of the holy ghoſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allureth vs to humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all pride.</note> which are proud beaſtes? is it not to giue vs to vnderſtand, that wee muſt behaue our ſelues modeſtly, plainly, and ſimply in all our actions? The ſimilitudes of the vine and the figge tree, ſo often propounded vnto vs in the olde and newe Teſtament, to figure the ſtate and condition of the children of God, tend they not to the ſame purpoſe? For the vine neuer groweth ſo high as the cheſſe-nut or the cedar trees, but alwaies runneth low by the ground. The figge tree groweth ſomewhat higher, but in this they agree, that both of them haue great and broad leaues, wherewith they couer their fruite in ſuch ſort that it can not be ſeene, vnleſſe you come ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neere them. So likewiſe, though Chriſtians ſhould be rich and plentifull in all good workes, to glorifie God in their liues, and to edifie their neighbours by their good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: yet muſt they carefully take heede, that they make no ſhewe thereof, as painters doe of their painted tables, or like vnto women which loue to ſet foorth themſelues, that euerie one may ſee their beautie and goodly attire,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23951:44"/>Which thing Chriſt reprooued in the Phariſes in his time:<note place="margin">Matth. 6.2.23.28.</note> You doe all your workes (ſaith he) to be ſeene of men, if you giue almes you blow a trumpet: if you pray, it is in the ſynagogues and the moſt apparant and frequented places: if you faſt, you looke ſower, and disfigure your countenances, as ſad and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons, to the end you may beſeene of all men, thereby to win you praiſe: but woe be vnto you, whom, men deceiued by your hipocriſie account bleſſed and happie. Who is there that conſidering theſe threatnings of God, would not forthwith deteſt and abhorre all vaine glorie?</p>
               <p>Men in former time thought it a pleaſant thing to heare their owne praiſes and commendations,<note place="margin">Good men are rather delighted with reproof, then with praiſes, and the wicked deal contrary</note> and pleaſant it is ſtill to ſuch as are carnally minded. But thoſe who haue receiued the ſpirit of God, and are regenerated, take no leſſe ſhame &amp; griefe to be praiſed, then they conceiue pleaſure and liking to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued and corrected. For they knowe very well, conſidering the manifold imperfections that are in them, and their daily tranſgreſſions, that one can neuer be plentifull enough in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fault with them: and contrariwiſe that the ſpeech vſed in their praiſes and commendations, can not be ſo compendious, but that it muſt needs containe many vntruthes: and withall that among all other things that appertaine vnto God, and are moſt deere vnto him, there is nothing that he more eſteemeth then his glory, and that without the profanation thereof, and ſhewing themſelues to be ſacrilegious perſons, they may in no wiſe take that which is giuen them. I adde this, for that it is not ſufficient (as <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith) that we be not deſirous of honor, and that we take it patiently, when it is denied vs: but we muſt refuſe it, and not take pleaſure in it, when it is offered vs. To this purpoſe <hi>Philon</hi> the Iewe applied the prohibition which God in old time made to the children of Iſrael, that they ſhould eate no leauened bread at the feaſt of Eaſter, ſaying, that the leauen which hath this propertie to ſower and to puffe vp the dow, was forbidden, thereby to teach them, that they ſhould alwaies auoid vainglory, which ſwelleth and puffeth vp the heart: and eſpecially at that time, when as they ſhoulde ſerue God moſt deuoutly, for that then it creepeth into mens mindes more ſpeedily, and that it is a hard matter for men
<pb facs="tcp:23951:45"/>which doe well, not to conceiue ſome great opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and highly to eſteeme of their actions, and delight to be eſteemed of others. Which is not ſpoken, but to the end wee ſhould not make ſuch eſtimation of the vertues &amp; good things which are in vs.</p>
               <p>We ſee that a little wormewood will quickly marre a whole veſſell of wine:<note place="margin">Pride cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth all our good workes.</note> in like maner, when as our life is moſt perfect and godly, yea moſt deuine and angelicall, the leaſt pride that may be will wholly corrupt it, and make it worſe and more imperfect then euer it was good. The reaſon is, for that we can doe nothing of our ſelues, wherein we haue not ſome confidence: and if we truſt in our ſelues we diſtruſt in God, if we diſtruſt in God, God forſaketh vs: and if he doth ſeparate himſelfe from vs, ſeeing he is the fountaine and well-ſpring of our life, and of euery good thing we haue, ſhall there any thing remaine for vs, but miſerie, ſinne, and malediction? It were a lamentable thing to ſee a marchant after a long and proſperous nauigation,<note place="margin">A fit ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> ſuffer ſhippewracke in the hauen, and loſſe of all in that place where he hoped to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and enioy the fruite of his former labours. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is it when a man (like vnto the <hi>Phariſie)</hi> hath liued well in this world, carefully obſeruing the commandements of God, and wiſely and politikely carried himſelfe among men, and in the end through a preſumption and pride in himſelfe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his neighbour, he vtterly caſteth himſelfe away, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing at the hands of God, but ſhame, confuſion, and condemnation, in ſtead of recompence and rewardes which were prepared for him, if he would haue kept himſelfe within the bounds of feare and humility.</p>
               <p>When as we are on the top of an hill or of ſome high place, we take good heede to our feete, and we walke warily for feare of ſtumbling: in like manner muſt they behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whom God hath exalted aboue others, either in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, knowledge, vertue, or wealth, or any other grace whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it hath pleaſed him to beſtow vpon them in particular ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſidering that the meanes to be preſerued and continued in that eſtate wherein they are, is to truſt in him, and continually to cleaue vnto him, to the end that they alwaies may liue in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23951:45"/>feare, and in humble maner retaine and keepe their minds in his obedience, in remembrance and conſideration of his goodnes.</p>
               <p>This would hinder and cloſe vp all the paſſages of pride and arrogancie,<note place="margin">Pride procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as of the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelues.</note> which proceed of nothing ſo much as of the want of knowledge of our miſerable eſtate wherein naturally we are placed, and of the forgetfulneſſe of the graces and good bleſſings of our God. The peacocke beholding his gay and goodly feathers waxeth forthwith very proud thereof, but as ſoone as he caſteth downe his eies, and looketh vpon his feete, which are farre different in beautie, his pride is quickly abated: likewiſe, if in reſpect of ſome prerogatiues and preeminences which God hath giuen vs aboue other men, we find our ſelues to be ſollicited by our fleſh,<note place="margin">The firſt meanes to repreſſe pride</note> or entiſed by the deuill to become proud, let vs conſider (as did <hi>Abraham, David, Iob,</hi> and <hi>Daniel)</hi> the better to repreſſe this pride, the duſt, corruption, vanity, yea and the nothing whereof we are made, and which we can not ſhake of. For the badges and tokens are ſo apparant in euery part of our nature,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> that hee is worſe then blind that can not ſee it. Let vs alſo conſider on the other ſide, that all the feathers whereof we bragge are borrowed, as thoſe of <hi>Eſops</hi> crow were, and that in appropriating them vnto our ſelues, we miniſter iuſt occaſion to God to take them from vs. Would we not laugh at a beggar,<note place="margin">An apt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> who hauing borrowed princely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell to play the part of ſome king vpon a ſtage, will needes afterward retaine his apparell ſtill, gloriouſly behauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in them, as if they were his owne? If in like maner a rich man would glory in his wealth, a Philoſopher in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a ſtrong man in his force, a marchant in his wealth, a woman in her beautie, or an hipocrite in his vertue, doe they not all deſerue to be laughed at? For this world is as it were a Theater, and all the honours and dignities which men haue therein, are as it were ſeuerall attires, which God hath diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted and giuen to euery one, as is moſt requiſite to play his part in, which is not to this end, to attribute them vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or to glory in them: but contrariwiſe to honour him who gaue them, and to help their neighbours.</p>
               <p>Which thing <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> hath notably declared in the
<pb facs="tcp:23951:46"/>booke he wrote againſt the two epiſtles of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A notable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of S. Auguſtin for confirmation of that which hath bin ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before.</note> which is here recited word for worde, to the end that euery one may fully vnderſtand it. Let the grace of God (ſaith he) be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that whoſoeuer will glorie may glorie in God, from the beginning of his conuerſion vnto the ende of his life. For as without the helpe of God no man can once beginne to doe well: ſo without him can hee not continue nor perfect any good thing. And therefore is it, that all the ſaintes, euen from righteous <hi>Abel</hi> vnto <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and after him, the Apoſtles vnto vs, and from vs vnto the ends of the world muſt bee commended not for any thing in themſelues, but for thoſe graces that haue proceeded from the Lord. For this is the confeſſion of thoſe, who liued vnder the lawe. In God my ſoule ſhal be praiſed. And thoſe who haue liued ſince them in the time of the goſpell haue ſaide, By the grace of God I am that I am. So that in generall, that which is written appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to all: if any one glorie, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now when as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> exhorteth vs to reioyce in God, he doeth not meane that it is ſufficient to acknowledge that all the good things we haue proceede from him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How wee ought to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the Lord.</hi> 1.

And to conclude, that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fauours and graces that it hath pleaſed God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs, be no occaſion to plucke out of our mindes the remembrance, and acknowledgement of the vices, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in our nature, which we ought continually to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the more to humble vs. For the grace of God is ſo conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the confeſſion of our ſinnes, that if we haue no feeling hereof, &amp; are not grieued and vexed with ſorowe and anguiſh which the memorie of them engendreth in our conſciences, we can not ſeeke for this his fauour, with all our hearts, nor aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſt in his mercy, nor yet praiſe him as we ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:23951:46"/>Wherefore it is not ſufficient that kings and other great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages whom God hath bleſſed in more abundant ſort,<note place="margin">How princes ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this caſe.</note> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they receiue theſe graces of God, nor that they thinke that in ſo doing they haue diſcharged themſelues of that honour &amp; praiſe due vnto him, or of that humility which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them: if they proceed not ſo far, as to do thoſe things aboue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned. And it is moſt requiſite that their counſellers, eſpecially they, who haue the charge of their ſoules doe often exhort them thereto, as well for the good of their ſubiects, as for the aſſurance &amp; amplification of their authorities. And it is out of doubt that they wil do ſo, if as good and faithful ſeruants they be careful of the welfare, honour and proſperity of their maſters: for there is nothing that is ſo neceſſary for the preſeruation of their kingdoms as to know themſelues, and ſo to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as hath bene ſaid before: and contrariwiſe nothing more dangerous, then for want of ſuch admonition to fall into a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of themſelues &amp; of God, without whoſe grace their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates can neither be durable nor proſperous, as may eaſily bee ſeene in reading of hiſtories. For euen from the beginning hath God alwaies ſhewed notable examples of his wrath &amp; anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ambitious &amp; proud princes, either by the commotions &amp; rebellions of their ſubiects, or by the conſpiracies of their friends &amp; ſeruants, or by the loſſe and depriuation of their dignities, or by ſome other greater calamities, to the end, that by theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſom other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering their harms ſhould take the better heed</p>
               <p>But there are fewe that conſider this, or that waxe wiſe by the miſerie of others: and what is the reaſon hereof? partly their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are content to keepe them in this ignorance,<note place="margin">The miſery of great men, who with their pride ouer throw themſelues and their ſubiects.</note> the better to lead them as blind men, whether it pleaſeth them: and partly they them ſelves love to be flattered, and to be perſwaded that they are gods, or demigods, vntill that death and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God teach them by wofull experience, that they are but mortall men, as well as others. But it is too late to knowe them, when as their knowledge doth profit them nothing, and that it bringeth nothing with it, but an extreme ſorrowe and a gnaſhing of the teeth, with a long and vnprofitable repentance. Wherefore it behooveth both them and vs, in time to provide to purchaſe that which is beſt for vs, and ſo to humble and caſt downe our ſelves, as wee may be the more readie, heartily and

And this is true. Nay it is more hard as <hi>Abdolonim</hi> anſwered <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when he made him king of his cuntry. <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> reporteth the ſtory, which I will recite briefly, for that it is moſt notable. This <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonim</hi> was a poore labouring man, with whom <hi>Epheſtion Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> great friend had much conuerſed, as taking great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the company and communication of this good man, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his wiſdom in the gouernment of his family, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his domeſticall actions. Now when <hi>Alexander</hi> had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the city and all the cuntry, hee demanded one day among his friends &amp; counſellers, whom they thought meeteſt to make king thereof, and to gouerne it in his abſence: whereto <hi>Epheſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> anſwered, that in his opinion none was more meete then his hoſt <hi>Abdolonim.</hi> The king in regard of his friend, and for the good report he had heard of him, preſently ſent for him, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon him princely robes, and giuing him the gouernment of the country. The poore man though aſtoniſhed with this ſodaine aduenture, yet notwithſtanding humbly thanked the king, and with ſo an aſſured countenance, graue modeſty, and ſuch wiſdome, that the king had him in great admiration. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many words paſſed betweene them, in the end <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:23951:49"/>demanded of him how he had maintained himſelfe, and in what maner he had indured his pouertie. Much better (ſaith he) then I feare me I ſhall endure my proſperity. This is the point of the ſtorie which I would apply to this my purpoſe, to prooue that it is a more difficult thing to conteine ones ſelfe in proſperitie, then in poore eſtate and miſerie: for that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of this world is, as it were, a fat and foule ground, where the waies are more durty and ſlipperie then are the barren and ſandie grounds. Wherefore it is requiſite that princes, and ſuch as God hath placed in higher eſtate then others, ſhoulde often meditate hereof, and of whatſoeuer elſe may humble them, and that they ſhould furniſh them ſelues with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion, the better to withſtand the fine flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and colourable treaſons of their fleſh, and fond for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Humility (as ſaieth <hi>Saint Chryſostome)</hi> is not onely the foundation of Chriſtian religion, but alſo of all true felicitie.<note place="margin">Of true and falſe humility</note> And to this purpoſe may that be applyed, which that great ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſometime ſpake of pronunciation, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded what was the firſt, ſecond, and third eſpeciall point of rhetoricke, anſwered alwaies Action: ſo may we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſay of true humilitie, that it is the principall part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, and as it were all in all, yea the life and ſoule thereof, ſo that it be true, entire, and vnfeigned. For there are ſome that are counterfeits, who haue nothing but the colour and ſhewe of this vertue, &amp; as it were the skin, wherwith oftentimes is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered great and wonderfull ambition. <hi>Saint Gregorie</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine in that funerall ſermon he made at the buriall of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſetteth downe certaine markes whereby it may bee knowne, for that in his time there were many philoſophers, yea and ſome of the miniſters of the Church, who by their hypocriſie abuſed many men.<note place="margin">Market to know hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites by.</note> There are ſome (ſaith hee) who haue a ſuperficiall and outward humilitie, wherewith they are couered, thereby to appeare the more holy, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein fooliſh women, who for that they want beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, colour their faces with paintings, one would iudge by their countenances that they are but counterfaites: they writhe the necke, they hang down their heads, they ſpeak low,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:50"/>they looke to the ground, they clippe the haire of their heades, they go ſlowly and eaſily: but Chriſtian humility conſiſteth not in this, but in the ſpirit and mind of man, when as we preſume not of our owne ſelues, and that we rather deſire and long after the truth in deed more then the apparance, and outward ſhew thereof.</p>
               <p>We may ſee at this day more then euer heretofore, that this, which this learned doctor wrote,<note place="margin">Againſt the feined humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our time, and wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth true humilitie.</note> is moſt true, &amp; that there are none more ambitious then ſuch as make a ſhew and profeſſion of humility. I will not ſpeake much of it, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to teach that which euery man knoweth, but my deſire is, and I beleeue verily that all ſuch as haue the feare of God doe ſo, that euery one ſhould thinke that true humilitie lieth not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of apparell, nor in the countenanee and viſage of a man, but in the mortification of our affections: &amp; among other of this deadly and damnable pride, which ſpringing and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with vs, ſo bewitcheth vs, that there is no man in the world which hath not ſome kinde of liking of himſelfe. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could ſay, that true humility conſiſteth not in mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhewes.<note place="margin">Cloaked bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly tanted.</note> It is reported that <hi>Socrates</hi> ſeeing <hi>Antisthenes</hi> the <hi>Cynicke</hi> Philoſopher bragging of his old cloake which hee did weare, ſhewing with a vaine oſtentation, the hole that was in it, as if thereby his humility ſhould appeare the greater in not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to weare ſo bad a garment, and taxing therewithal the pride of other men, who were ſumptuouſly apparelled: I ſee (ſaith <hi>Socrates)</hi> the pride of <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> through the hole of his cloake. The like is reported of <hi>Plato,</hi> who was as curious &amp; neate in his apparell, as carefull to haue euery thing in fineſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner about his chamber, into the which when as vpon a time that dogged <hi>Diogenes</hi> entred, and ſeeing his bed trimly and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely made, hee forthwith wallowed vpon it, ſaying, that hee would ſtamp <hi>Platos</hi> pride vnder his feete: Yea (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> that you will, with an other pride far greater. Whereby wee may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntlie ſee, that humilitie conſiſteth not in the contempt of ciuilitie and good maners, much leſſe in an affecting of rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and clowniſhneſſe, but rather in a diſlike and diſpleaſure we take at our ſelues, proceeding of the acknowledgement, and liuely feeling of our poore and miſerable eſtates.</p>

               <p>Man muſt therefore (the better to knowe his owne nature) obſerve theſe and the like ſentences in reading of the ſcriptures, and diligently to ponder them in his minde, not for a day or two, but all his life long, and to make them ſerve as as a glaſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the face of his owne ſoule, and that as curiouſly to viewe

For as (the proverbe ſaith) he that is pore-blinde may go for a king a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as are ſtarke blinde. But if we wil examine our eſtate with our original, which is the image &amp; ſemblance of God, and compare man as he now is with the firſt project, &amp; as he was, we ſhall quickly confeſſe that to be true of all men,<note place="margin">Eſay 5.1.</note> which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the vine (that is, of Iſrael &amp; Iuda the choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God) that the firſt plant was very good &amp; fruitful, but now it is become wild, &amp; like vnto the brembles and briars, nay we may ſay more, (&amp; that truely) that it is like a wood full of briars and thornes.</p>
               <p>We ought alſo to conſider by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are praiſed,<note place="margin">The ſixs meanes.</note> for if ſuch as praiſe them be not wiſe &amp; honeſt, their praiſe is nothing but a diſpraiſe. <hi>Antigone</hi> (after the death of <hi>Zenon)</hi> was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his apotheg.</note> that his ſtage was throwen down, meaning thereby, that he was the only man whom he thought meeteſt to iudge of his actions, and by whoſe ſole and only approbation they might be allowed or diſliked. <hi>Phocion</hi> having made an eloquent oration before the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> perceiving that the multitude did highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for it, demaunded of ſuch as ſtood next him, if he had vttered any abſurd or fooliſh thing: giving vs thereby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we ought alwayes to ſuſpect the applauſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not onely for that they can hardly diſcerne betweene vice &amp; vertue, but alſo becauſe their affections are ſo corrupt, that often times they embrace the evill rather then the good, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe are they by whome the ambitious ſort of men doe ſo greedily ſeeke to be commended, which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceived by the examples of the Grecians and Romanes:
<pb facs="tcp:23951:52"/>for what banquets, ſportes, playes, triumphes, and other prodigal and exceſſive expenſes made the great princes of thoſe nations, to winne the good willes of a light and brainſicke multitude? and doe not many Devines, Phiſitions, Captaines, and ſuch as are accounted wiſe men, by whoſe commendation other mens actions ſhould either ſtand orfall, run in the ſame path? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we doe notably bewray our folly. For we would ſcorne that man, that would bring a blinde man to iudge of colours; and yet we conſider not, when we endevour in this ambitious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to get the favour of the ignorant ſort, that we commit the cenſuring of our life to a witleſſe multitude, and ſuch as can not diſcerne betweene good and bad.</p>

                  </note> is to conſider our ſelves in the iudgement of God. For as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of a man is never throughly tryed, vnleſſe it be well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before a wiſe and ſevere iudge: ſo likewiſe doe we not knowe who we are, if we be not tryed before God, that great Iudge, who ſeeth and knoweth all thinges, and who hath all the informations and proceſſe of our lives, and vnderſtandeth the very thoughtes and counſels of our heartes, according to the which we muſt either be acquitted or condemned. For he being without al affection, by reaſon of the pureneſſe and ſynceritie of his eſſence, can no wayes be corrupted in his iudgement, and therefore moſt meete to iudge the whole worlde. Wherefore it is convenient, that every one committing his cauſe vnto him, ſhould not thinke his actions iuſt and lowable, vntill they bee ſo approoved by his ſentence; in thus doing, no queſtion but it will quickely abate our pride. For if we be afraide of mortall iudges, who may be abuſed and corrupted, and that there is no man be he never ſo innocent, ſeeing his proceſſe drawen, and his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in hazzard of their iudgement, but imagineth that his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie can not be ſo great, if all his doing be well examined, but that he ſhall be found faultie in many pointes. What ſhall we then do conſidering the juſtice of our God, who by reaſon of his infinite wiſedome can not be ignorant of the ſecret thoughts of our heartes, nor yet will diſſemble them conſidering his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable will, by reaſon whereof he will in no wiſe decline from the trueth? Shall we not confeſſe then (ſetting before our eyes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23951:52"/>ſuch a iudgement as this) that we are but duſt and aſhes, as did <hi>Abraham?</hi> ſhall we not hide our ſelves before his face as did <hi>Helias?</hi> ſhall we ſtande before him ſeeing <hi>Iob</hi> was throwen downe? ſhall not we deſire him, with <hi>David,</hi> not to examine our offences, but for his mercie ſake to forget them, and to bury them in the grave with his ſonne Chriſt? Yes ſurely, and to moove him to be the more gratious vnto vs, with theſe our humble petitions we would put on ſackecloth and aſhes, as did <hi>Daniel</hi> in Babylon, and in ſo doing we would ſoone ſhake off the former opinion of our owne vertues, conſidering we muſt appeare in the preſence of our God, before whome (conſidering our manifolde imperfections) we can not ſtande, but we muſt needes be as much aſhamed, as any diſeaſed and ragged beggar would be in the preſence of a great and mightie prince.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the morall Philoſophers have bene very paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and induſtrious in deſcribing the other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and vnruly affections of the minde: ſo have they bene exceeding plentifull in the vnfolding of the manifolde miſchiefes and vexations, which are inſeparably annexed vnto this diſtempered humour, as may evidently appeare by thoſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſcourſes which <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> have left behinde them, with the which (eſpecially that of <hi>Plutarch)</hi> the Authour hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably furniſhed his booke, and that in three especiall pointes. In the firſt he diſcourſeth of thoſe evils and inconveniences, which <hi>Anger</hi> breedeth. In the ſecond, of the cauſes which produce and bring foorth theſe evils. In the third, of the remedies and preſervatives againſt ſo furious and raging a torment, which not without great difficultie is aſſwaged, as ſaith <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> becauſe it spareth not (no not with the spilling of blood, and loſſe of life) to attaine his deſired purpoſe. The firſt braunch is devided into ſixe principall partes, wherein are evidently demonſtrated the ſtrange and monſtrous effectes that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger produceth: as that it extinguiſheth the light of reaſon, and berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth vs of all vertuous actions, cauſing ſuch confuſion and diſorder as raigne in every part and corner of the worlde, overthrowing and diſfiguring both body and ſoule, and being the principall bellowes that Sathan vſeth to blowe the fire of ſo many monſtrous and foule abuſes, by transforming men into devils, and obſcuring whatſoever is good
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23951:53"/>and godly, tyrannizing and oppreſſing in most fearefull manner by threatning and rebuking with rigorous wordes and ſharpe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the well ordered motions of a quiet minde, as may appeare by the oppoſition and contradiction of the nature thereof, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which God hath commaunded. And the effectes of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are ſo hainous and execrable, that wee can not but condemne them in another, though we be wholly poſſeſſed with them our ſelves. The more ſecrete and covert that it is, the more daungerous it is. It maketh our tongues to runne riote, and cauſeth vs to commit moſt grievous faultes. It is a very hell and torment to thoſe who are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therewith, and the plague and destruction of the whole worlde. It maketh man to forget him ſelfe, neither permitteth him to followe good counſell, having illuſtrated theſe ſever all partes with notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, fitte ſimilitudes, worthie ſayings, and vnfallible reaſons draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en both from morall and devine philoſophie, (before he commeth to the ſecond parte) he ſheweth that the great men of the world above all other, ought to take eſpeciall regarde, that they be not overcome with this chollericke paſſion, annexing hereunto ſound and pithie proofes out of histories, that Clemencie is a vertue moſt beſeeming princes &amp; great Perſonages, and therefore he giveth them notable receiptes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this daungerous poyſon of anger, ſhewing why Clemencie and Mercie is meeter for them then Wrath and Anger: Illuſtrating both by ſeverall examples, with concluſion that Mercie is the moſt notable vertue in Kings &amp; great ſtates, if ſo be that it be wiſely vſed.</p>
                  <p>Nowe for the ſecond point, he prooveth by divers examples that pride is as it were the spring and principall cauſe of anger; againſt which he oppoſeth modeſtie as a counter-poyſon, alledging to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe famous histories, and anſwereth at large to thoſe, who deride and mocke at the great patience of ſome particular men among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. The ſecond cauſe of this vnbrideled affection he noteth to bee ſelfe-love: and againſt this he oppoſeth the frugall and sparing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of many notable men, which is amplified by a deepe and mature conſideration of the behaviour of ſuch men, as have bene truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, prooving (the better to adorne and beautifie this his diſcourſe) that anger is an vnfallible proofe of inconſtancie, infidelitie, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, impietie, and of dispaire: then by the way he propoſeth and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe a chriſtian and godly meditation of thoſe ſinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof we are culpable before God by reaſon of our pride, and
<pb facs="tcp:23951:54"/>impatiencie, and to aggravate our condemnation he doeth lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vnto vs the nature of God, which is full of mercie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and continuing his diſcourſe; he ſheweth that overmuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie and ſuspition is the third cauſe of this diſtempered affection: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the which he oppoſeth prudence, which diſſimuleth and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many faultes. The fourth cauſe he noteth to be the inconſtancie and lightneſſe of the minde, which is carryed away with every reporte and flying tale: and this is ſtayed and governed by a wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete mildeneſſe. The fift cauſe he alledgeth to be our pride, which ſo farre transporteth vs, that we have no regarde in bearing with the infirmitie of our brethren; and therefore ſetteth downe the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that muſt drawe vs thereto, plentifully adorning them with many notable andexcellent compariſons. Having diſcourſed of theſe v. principall cauſes which produce &amp; ingender anger, in the latter end be ſetteth downe the particular remedies of this diſeaſe, which are <hi>4.</hi> The firſt, that we muſt ſtoppe the beginnings of anger. The ſeconde, that being kindled, we muſt foorthwith ſeeke howe to quench it: and anſwereth to thoſe rufflers, who account thoſe ſtout and valiant men, who wreke their anger with the ſworde. The third remedie is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he prooveth to be moſt neceſſarie for Christians. And laſtly, he exhorteth and admoniſheth every one carefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently topray vnto God, to give him his grace and aſſistance, that he may followe theſe rules which he hath ſet downe for the avoyding of Anger.</p>

But when as (through his great proſperitie) he became proude,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23951:55"/>and pride engendered wrath, impaciencie, impudencie, and outrage; then began hee to fall to dronkennes, and deſpiſe the Macedonians, by whoſe vertue and valiancie he had conquered all Aſia, diſdaining to be called the ſonne of Philip his father, being a mortall man, and would needs be accounted a god, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on forwards to the murdering of his friends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many other outrages, which afterwardes (though too late) brought repentance, which is a thing incident to all raſh and haſtie perſons. The <hi>Athenians</hi> enacted a lawe, that their Oratours and counſellours in pleading for their clyents, ſhould not labour to moove the Iudge to pitie or to choler, either in the beginning or ende of his ſpeach: meaning hereby that there is nothing that more hindereth the vprightneſſe of our iudgement, then ſuch perturbations and troubles of the minde.

And as out of our hearts ſpringeth the fountaine of our life, ſo alſo from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proceedeth the ſpring of honeſt and vertuous living, which incontinently faileth and periſheth, as ſoone as the ſpring decayeth, and therefore it is requiſite that we imbrace vertue, and ſeeke to live honeſtly, and that we moſt carefully provide for the preſervation of the health of our reaſon, eſchewing ſo neere as we may, what ſoever may be hurtfull vnto it: as all vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions of the minde, and choler eſpecially, which is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to patience and all moderate actions what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.<note n="1" place="margin">Choler ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth all goodneſſe, and firſt of all the ſtare of God.</note>

               <p>Seeing then, that anger taketh away the vſe of reaſon, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thereof that it breedeth the ruine of all vertue, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of all pietie and feare of God: ſeeing it provoketh vs to blaſpheme the name of the Almightie: and withall ſeeing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23951:56"/>that it engendereth hatred towardes our neighbours, and no man hating them, can pray vnto God as he ought, or deſire his mercie for the remiſſion of his ſinnes, ſeeing it is promiſed with this condition, that we ſhould forgiue our enemies their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If then the principall parts of true religion, be faith, prayer, the feare and reverence of the name of our God, to all which, this angrie humour is a mortall enemie, it muſt needes be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if we ſuffer it once to reſt in vs, it forthwith draweth vs to a contempt and miſtruſt of God.</p>
               <p>And as this paſſion is contrarie to the ſervice we owe vnto God,<note n="2" place="margin">Charitie.</note> ſo doth it directly oppoſe it ſelfe againſt charitie, which is due to our neighbours, and by conſequent, to all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements compriſed therein. And if the lawe be a worde of life, and that he which meditateth therein day and night be bleſſed, are not theſe vnhappie and dangerous paſſions, which make vs ſo boldly to tranſgreſſe this law? Choler likewiſe is an enemie to <hi>iuſtice,</hi> which cannot be adminiſtred but by quiet, moderate,<note n="3" place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> and temperate men: and therfore <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaith, that where braules are, there lawes beare no ſway; and <hi>Antigonus</hi> thus anſwered one, who made an excellent and eloquent oration before him, in the commendation of Iuſtice, at his entrie into <hi>Aſia</hi> with a mightie armie: art thou ſo vnwiſe (ſaith he) to ſpeake of Iuſtice to a King, which hath his ſword in his hand? <hi>Marius</hi> likewiſe that great Captaine of Rome, who had beene ſeven times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul vnderſtanding that ſome blamed him for that he did many things in the warres contrarie to the lawes and cuſtomes of the common wealth, ſaid he could not heare them for the noiſe &amp; clattering of the weapons: ſignifying hereby,<note n="4" place="margin">Modeſtie.</note> that where wrath and anger raigneth, there is neither equitie nor iuſtice.

               <p>In like maner it deſtroyeth patience,<note n="5" place="margin">Patience and humility.</note> which is a vertue moſt neceſſarie for all Chriſtians to retaine them in that hope they haue in God: whereto they ought likewiſe to leane in their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and temptations, leaſt they ſtumble and fall.

               <p>It taketh away alſo that magnanimitie and courage,<note n="7" place="margin">Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> which doth not onely conſiſt in the reſiſting of the aſſaults and alarmes of forraine enemies, but alſo in the beating downe of thoſe rebellious motions which would riſe vp within vs, if they were not brideled and kept in awe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>In like manner it taketh away that facilitie from vs,<note n="8" place="margin">Affabilitie.</note> which ſhould make vs ſo affable vnto all men, that none ſhould feare to converſe with vs, or ſhould not be grieved to forſake vs.</p>
               <p>Moreover it bereaveth vs of all compaſſion,<note n="9" place="margin">Compaſſion</note> which we ſhould vſe towards our neighbours to comfort them, and to be grieved with them in their afflictions, to ſupport them in their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to withdraw them for their errours, and to be ſorie for thoſe ſinnes which may happen either to bodie or ſoule.</p>

               <p>And in a word,<note n="3" place="margin">Choler is the cauſe of the confuſions and troubles in the world.</note> there is nothing more contrarie to that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and humanitie, which ſhould be among men, then this paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it is as the roote and ſpring of the greateſt part of the tumults, warres, partakings, brabbles, murthers, and deſolations that are in the worlde. For howe many mortall and deadly bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels have there beene for ſmall trifles? what troubles in the law? what falling out among moſt deere friends? what enimitie and heart-burning hath this vnrulie affection bred? the gentleman to revenge him ſelfe and wreke his anger, ſelleth or giveth away
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23951:57"/>his landes, and often hazardeth his honour, his life, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The marchant leaveth his trade, the husbandeman ſelleth plough and cattell, the artificer his tooles, and all to maintaine his ſuite againſt his enemie, and to ſatisfie his owne angrie minde. And the caſe is ſo much the more lamentable, for that ſuch men are accounted vertuous and of great courage; as though <hi>Moyſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> him ſelfe, were leſſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then theſe men, or as though there were not greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in bearing wrong, then in an obſtinate deſire of revenge. And it is not ſufficient for vs to love this vice, but wee muſt needes give it a good and vertuous name. Is not Eſay his prophecie verified in vs, that wee call e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill good, and good evill? for wee live in thoſe times when as this fault is but too common; for veritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong moſt men is not regarded, and lyes and fables are received as vnfallible truthes. Superſtition is adored in the greateſt part of the worlde, and true religion accounted as a late invention of newe vpſtart wittes. And to come neare to our purpoſe, milde and gentle behaviour is accounted faint-hearted cowardlineſſe, and a revenging minde is honoured with the commendation of a heroicall and noble ſpirite. And if this were the errour of the common ſorte, it might bee more patiently borne withall: but the better ſort (which is an exceeding ſhame) or to ſpeake more fitlie, a deſperate impudencie, doe approove it by their conſent. For if a man will endure the lie to be given him, as fearing the commaundement of God, which forbiddeth revenge, &amp; therfore committeth his cauſe vnto him, he is ſtraight noted with the brande of infamie. If hee be a ſouldiour, hee is ſtraight diſgraced and thruſt out as a cowardlie beaſt, and one of no ſtomacke or valour, though in deede there be none more valiant, then ſuch as can vanquiſh their owne affections, ſeeing they be the moſt daungerous enemies we have, and ſo accuſtomed to overrule vs, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually our maſters. I can but wonder that among ſuch as carie the reputation of wiſe men, there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that woulde iudge the revenge of everie wrong, to bee a noble and an heroicall action. For this is as if

And yet the anger and wrath of God is alwaies iuſt, and there are no affections in him, that may turne him eyther to the right hande or to the left, as are in men, who are never angrie for the moſt part, but are violently caried by affection, without reaſon or regarde.

               <p>The propertie and nature of GOD is to create and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: the nature of wrath is to ſpoyle and deſtroye.

VVhereof it muſt needes followe, that if wee love God entirely as the Autour of our lives, and of all whatſoever is requiſite for the preſervation of them, wee muſt needes deteſt Choller, as the greateſt enemie and principall cauſe of moſt of theſe miſchiefes that may ſhorten our dayes, and make them yrkeſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>

               <p>The Chriſtian man after his regeneration ought to betake him ſelfe wholly to the ſervice of God, to glorifie him both in bodie and minde, ſo much as is poſſible. Our ſoule muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually praiſe him with all the power it hath, and our bodie with all the partes thereof, eſpecially our tongues and mouthes ought to bee principall inſtruments particularly, as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and dedicated to the honour of God, whoſe goodneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:23951:61"/>wee ought to commende without ceaſing, and extoll his Name aloude, as it were, with a trumpet: nothing ought to proceede out of them but that which is holye and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For they are, as it were, the gates of Chriſtian mens heartes, which are the Temples and treaſures of GOD. And therefore <hi>David</hi> ſheweth vs what is the duetie and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a regenerate man in theſe wordes. Let the wordes of my mouth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.14.</note> and the meditation of my heart bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in thy ſight. By this and many other places wee may gather, that the principall vſe of our tongues conſiſteth in prayer and thankeſgiving to GOD: and next to this, in inſtructing, in comforting, in confirming, and reprooving our neighboures in all good manner that wee may. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did cut off the head of a certaine Grecian, who was ſent of Embaſſage from the great King of Perſia, for that hee had taught the Barbarians his native tongue, which might bee perverted to the harme of his countrey.</p>
               <p>What puniſhment then doeth hee deſerve, who beeing regenerated by the grace of God and made a newe creature, (and therefore ought to honour him, and live according to his worde, ſhewing all obedience both with heart and bodie) giveth his tongue (which the Holy Ghoſt ſhould have, to make him ſing out the praiſes of God his Father) to ſerve the Devill, in blaſpheming, lying, ſlaundering, reviling, ſcoffing, and ſuch like thinges, whereto our anger provoketh vs? This onely reaſon ought to remoove all the gall and bitterneſſe out of our ſtomackes. For what is there that wee ought to be ſo carefull of, as of the moſt noble and excellent parte that is in vs, and that which GOD principally requireth of vs? whereby ſhall men better knowe that wee are Chriſtians, then if wee be zealous of Chriſtes trueth? Are not theſe the very true badges and tokens of Chriſtianitie, to ſpeake of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and heavenly thinges? and as Chriſt ſaith, to bleſſe thoſe who curſe vs, and alwayes to ſpeake of the praiſes of our God? to meditate of him, and of his lawe, and to ſet ſuch a watche before our mouthes, that no vile or filthie thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede out of them, but ſuch thinges as may tende to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

For time doth not ripen the fruits of the earth alone, but likewiſe our counſels and cogitations: and therefore as the fruit is long on the tree before it can be gathered, ſo muſt our deliberations and counſels be in our minds, before they be vttered. Otherwiſe we muſt thinke of them, as of the youngling that is borne before the time: and ſuch are the counſels vſually of a haſtie headed man, and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſalme 7.</note> that ſuch an one travelleth with wickednes, conceiveth miſchiefe, and bringeth forth a lie.

Wherefore <hi>S. Baſil</hi> compareth theſe angrie and peeviſh perſons to ſottiſh drunkardes, for that both of them being void of reaſon, are not capable of any good inſtruction.

               <p>I would to God, that we (who are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and doe bragge to our great ſhame, of our knowledge of good and evill, &amp; vaunt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23951:71"/>of a better hope of the life to come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had theſe poore paynims) would imitate them in their vertues, in the love, in the ſtudie and practiſe of theſe glorious actions which we ſo greatly commend in them, and ſo often repeat to their great glorie, and no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie to our ſelves. How many ſhall we find informer ages who did moſt notably reſiſt the iniuries offered them? But wee are ſo froward, that is to ſay, ſo baſe of heart, and yet ſo proudly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and puffed vp with a vaine opinion of our ſelves, often times without cauſe, and for the moſt part for indifferent things, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſtrength, beautie, gentrie, and reputation; we preſume, I ſay, ſo farre beyond meaſure, for theſe and the like tranſitorie things, that we are not ſo ſoone ſtirred, but we will ſtirre againſt King and Councell, high and lowe, and miniſter ſufficient matter to Poets to make newe Tragedies.</p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome man wil ſay, that the reaſon why theſe Philoſophers did ſo patiently beare theſe wrongs which were offered them, was, for that they wanted abilitie to revenge them ſelves. Whereto I will not anſwer, that by reaſon of their great knowledge and eloquence, they might have left the memoriall of their friends by their writings eterniſed forever, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed their enemies to all poſterities, which in my conceit is the greateſt revenge that may be. But I ſay that not onely theſe pore paynims were lowly and patient, but even mightie Princes have imitated or rather ſurpaſſed them, as <hi>Antigonus</hi> who being in his tent and hearing his ſouldiours ſpeake evill of him,<note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in his</hi> Apoth.</note> went forth and bade them goe further off, that he might not heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We need not demand here what he might iuſtly have done, nor what they deſerved, nor yet what many of our Captaines would haue done in the like caſe; but rather let vs conſider the example of this mild Prince, &amp; ſtudie to follow him, and to reproove our ſelves as often as we are prone to anger, &amp; ready to revenge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wrong that is offered vs, ſeeing we are ſlowe ynough to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence any pleaſure that is done vnto vs. The ſame <hi>Antigonus</hi> while he was beſieging a citie, hard ſome of the beſieged mocke him, for that he had a deformed countenance: while for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he anſwered nothing but this: that in his owne conceit hee was faire ynough. But not long after, having gotten the citie, hee tooke alſo the ſcoffers, and to chaſtiſe them for their faults hee ſold them as ſlaves, and adviſed them not to ſcorne him any
<pb facs="tcp:23951:72"/>more, if they did, he would tel their maſters. Wherein he ſhewed a marveilous moderation as well at the preſent laughing at their pride,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as alſo not long after in puniſhing their fault. There was alſo an auncient <hi>Grecian</hi> named <hi>Arcadion,</hi> who ſpake evill of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonie</hi> whereſoever he became, which when the Kings friendes vnderſtood, they counſelled the King to puniſh him ſeverely, to the example of all others. But this good Prince (contrarie to the faſhion and cuſtome of many in theſe daies) was more milde in puniſhing theſe indignities offered him. For meeting on a time this common backbiter, firſt ſpake very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto him, after conferred with him privately, beeing departed from him, ſent him home great and riche giftes. A two or three moneths after he enquired of his friendes, what <hi>Arcadion</hi> ſaid of him, who anſwered that they thought no man in the world ſpake more honourably of the King, then he did. Whereto the King anſwered, that hee well perceived he was a better phiſitian then they all, and that a diſcreete and moderate mildnes, is often times more forceable to correct mens corrupt manners, then haſtie &amp; froward dealings. The ſame King being advertiſed (as there are ſome alwaies about Princes that are more prone to incenſe them to choler, then to pacifie their anger) that there were ſome at the Olympian games, that in their ſports did often touch his roy all maieſtie, and that very tauntingly, contrarie to their allegiance and duetie, in reſpect of the great benefits he had don vnto them, and therefore they deſerved ſevere puniſhment. What (ſaid the King) if the <hi>Grecians</hi> having received ſo great ayde and comfort of mee, yet will ſpeake evill of me; what would they doe, if I ſhould doe as you counſell me? He that will well conſider the power and might that ſo great a King had to revenge himſelfe, and withall the occaſion that was offered by the importunitie, ingratitude, and weakens of his enemies, as alſo the counſell and perſwaſion of his friends, which incenſed him to be revenged: finally in reſpect of his honour and dignitie, which ſeemed to be diminiſhed in diſſembling ſuch an iniurie, muſt needes confeſſe that his conſtancie and mildnes was wonderfull, and worthie to be remembred for ever of all great ſtates.<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> It is reported that the comicall Poet <hi>Philemon,</hi> having diſgraced <hi>Magus</hi> vpon the ſtage, as it is an vſuall thing for players to do, who are ruled more

Whereat many gentlemen which ſtoode by were ſore offended, crying out that ſuch audaciouſneſſe was not tollerable. But the King (who was milde, and knewe himſelfe in fault, for that he had given the firſt occaſion of ieſting) anſwered: that if it were an vnſeemely thing for a King to beare an iniurie, it was as evil a thing for him to offer a wrong. <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> beeing advertiſed that many things were ſpoken in Rome, to the diſhonour of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his father in lawe, tolde it to his ſaide father, and ſtirred him all that might be to give commaundement to ſearch out thoſe backbiters, to the end they might be puniſhed as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But the good Emperour (who was nothing mooved with ſuch reports) anſwered very mildely, that he would ſuffer them ſo long as they did but ſpeake evill: for in ſuch a free citie as Rome was, mens tongues ſhould be at libertie.</p>
               <p>We may ſee by theſe examples above mentioned, and ſuch like, that a temperate and humble ſpirit was a very familiar thing in olde time, as well to the great Monarches, as to the poore Philoſophers, but it was farre more admirable in the one then in the other; for that in the furie and heat of warre they were ſo milde, and alwaies ruled by reaſon, though the ſworde were in their handes, vvhich ſurely proceeded
<pb facs="tcp:23951:73"/>of a maruelous modeſtie which was in them ouer there is in vs. For though they ſurpaſſed vs in wiſdom, and in al kind of vertue, notwithſtanding we exceede them in an opinion of our ſelues, which is ſo exceeding, that we imagine there is no honour, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or reward, which in our conceit we haue not well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Whereof it proceedeth, that when we are not ſo honored as we deſire, or when any diſcommend that in vs which we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme highly of, we fret and fume like a pedlar that heareth his wares diſpraiſed. And that this pride is the principall cauſe, that maketh vs ſo froward, it euidently appeareth in that we are ſoone appeaſed, if he who hath offended vs, will once ſubmit himſelfe vnto vs, and excuſe himſelfe, ſhewing vs that he did it not of any vnreverent regard he had of vs, or of contempt: but for want of diſcretion, good counſell, through fraileneſſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. And therefore I aduiſe thoſe, who are ſo prone to anger, (the better to repreſſe their rage) to haue alwaies ſuch imaginations in their heads, and to force themſelues to excuſe the faults which are committed againſt them, attributing them (if they be enemies) to their want of diſcretion, if they be frends to their familiaritie, if ſeruants to their rudeneſſe, and ſo likewiſe of others. For there is nothing (as I haue ſaid before) that doth more vexe vs, then when we imagine we are contemned and deſpiſed of others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe is ſelfe-loue,<note place="margin">The ſecond occaſion is ſelfe-love.</note> which is alwaies vnited and tied to a vaine and delicate curioſitie. Which is euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in all thoſe who are ouer curious in their attire, in their meat, diet, and ſuch like. For you ſhall ſee ſuch men oftentimes fall out with their wiues, their friends and ſeruants, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuually chiding with one or other, either for that his meat is not well ſeaſoned, or that ſome ſticke is ſmoking in the chimney, or for that there is no ſalt vpon the table, or that his bread is not wel baked, or that the candle is not well put out, or the napkins not well waſhed, his cloake not cleane bruſhed, his horſe not well curried, his glaſſes broken, or for ſome ſuch light and ſlender occaſion. For theſe delicate felowes are as tender and as eaſie to hurt as he that is trobled with the gout, which maketh them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to cry out before they be touched. Wherby it falleth out that they get ſuch an angry habit, that through an ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtirring &amp;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23951:73"/>concuſſion of the lungs, they engender ſuch a froward vlcer, as prooueth incurable.

We need but once aske mercie and forgiuenes at thy hands, and we ſhall obtaine it: for as the Prophet ſaith, Thoſe who feele the burthen of their ſinnes, and are worne away by reaſon of their tranſgreſſions, thoſe doeſt thou behold with the eies of pitie and compaſſion, and putteſt all their wickedneſſe farre out of thy ſight.

Thou makeſt thy ſunne to ſhine, and the raine to fall vpon the ground of the iuſt and vniuſt, to make their lands fructifie and bring forth plentie. But we are ſo perverſe &amp; frowarde, that having once conceived evil of a man, we wil not ſo much as ſuffer him to light his candle at our fire. And the principall cauſe of all this, is a fleſhly and carnall love moſt curſed and wicked, which we beare toward our ſelves. For that which <hi>S.

               <p>There is alſo a third cauſe of anger,<note n="3" place="margin">Curioſitie &amp; ſuperſtition, the thirde cauſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> which is a curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every thing, and a deſire to knowe whatſoever either our wives, children, or ſervants doe: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that we knowing or ſuſpecting any ſmall trifles, ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might be concealed from vs, or diſſembled by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great harme, we both vexe our ſelves and others very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſundrie times about them.

                  </note> and after him <hi>Lewes</hi> the xj. is very availeable againſt this miſchiefe, and muſt be remembred. And that is, that he that knoweth not how to diſſemble, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not howe to live. For this is not expedient for Kings onely, but for all that are in authoritie, and have any charge whatſoever. For if a maſter of a familie will rule his children and ſervants well, and bee both beloved and feared of them, hee muſt both ſhut his eyes and ſtoppe his eares, ſo that he neither heare nor ſee many youthfull parts which they play.

There are ſome thinges which a man muſt looke vnto him ſelfe, ſome thinges he may commit to his wife, and other thinges to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervaunts; as did <hi>Moſes,</hi> who committed the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſmall matters to ſuch as he had choſen out among the people for that purpoſe, by the counſell and advice of his father in Lawe <hi>Iethro,</hi> reſerving matters of greateſt conſequence for him ſelfe, which thing brought no ſmall reſt and quiet to his minde.</p>
               <p>There is another thing alſo that maketh vs very Chollericke and frowarde,<note n="4" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 4. <hi>cauſe of anger, is a light beliefe of every tale that is brought vs.</hi> Pſalm. 120.</note> and that is, that wee are readie to heare and beleeve every reporte that is brought vs. For it is impoſſible (as the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was wont to ſay) but that hee which hath long eares ſhould alſo have bloody handes; for that (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith) ſlaunderous and deceitfull tongues are as the ſharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of Iuniper, giving vs thereby to vnderſtand what ſorowe and vexation they bring vnto as many as are content to heare them. And therefore if we will live peaceably, we muſt in any wiſe avoyde all ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and backebiters, imitating herein the example of this good King, who writing of this matter, ſheweth what order and governement hee vſed in his houſe,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 101.</note> ſaying, He that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlaundereth his neighbour, will I deſtroy: him that hath a proude looke and high heart, I can not ſuffer.

For there was never yet any Prince, but if he woulde give eare vnto lyers, he was ſtraight a Tyrant, being induced to injurie the wiſeſt and graveſt Counſellours about him, by meanes of their flatterie and deceitfull practiſes, whereof we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimonie in the examples of <hi>Dyoniſius, Tiberius, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,

               <p>There is alſo another reaſon that maketh vs very prone to choller, and that is,<note n="5" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 5. <hi>cauſe of choller is that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the infirmities of our weake brethren, for that we will not beare with them, and the ſleightes and cunning of Sathan. Plutarch in his treatiſe of anger.</hi>

               <p>Moreover it were expedient that their faultes ſhould inſtruct vs, and cauſe vs to remember and conſider our whole lives, as did <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſeeing a man diſſolutely and lewdly diſpoſed,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his treatiſe of anger.</note> would foorthwith examine him ſelfe whether he were culpable in the like or not. For we ſhall ſee, if wee examine our ſelves well, that we are faultie in as great or greater matters, as he with whome we are angrie. And thus we ſhall moderate and temper our paſſionate mindes ſome what the better, and it will make vs much more friendly and familiar with them, with whome we live, and nothing ſo rough and churliſh as are thoſe men, who never reſpect the infirmitie of their neighbours, when as we ſee any of our friendes or neighbours fallen into any malladie or diſeaſe, though the diſeaſe wherein they are, happeneth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe their owne folly, and by meanes of ſome diſorder they have vſed, yet we are moved with compaſſion and pitie towards them: what ſhall we then doe, when as through the occaſion of their faultes and tranſgreſſions wee are mooved to conſider and beholde that great and horrible corruption of our owne
<pb facs="tcp:23951:78"/>nature, which having begunne in our firſt parents, have ſince that time ſpread it ſelfe as a moſt filthie and contagious botch, over all their poſteritie, and which even like a running ſcabbe hath perced into the marow and ſinewes of our ſoules, and that in ſuch ſort, that wee are become lame and vnable to doe any good thing whatſoever?<note n="3" place="margin">The latter part of the diſcourſe, wherein the Authour ſheweth ſome particular remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt choler, whereof the firſt is, that it is good to ſtop it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and not to ſuffer it till it be begun. An example of Socrates. Plutarch in his treatiſe of anger.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is good alſo (the better to repreſſe our anger) that we deale with it, as we vſe to deale with fire, which with great and earneſt endevour we ſeeke to quench, when as it firſt beginneth to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, not expecting till it hath taken the beames and rafters of the houſe, or any other ſolide matter whereby it may be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, for then it is too late to prevent it. In like manner wee muſt not ſtay till wee burne and flame with anger, but aſſoone as ever wee feele our ſelves diſpoſed therevnto, and that the pulſe of our hearts begins to beate more quicke then is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for a right and wholeſome temperature. Whenſoever <hi>Socrates</hi> in talking with his friends, perceived him ſelfe mooved with this paſſionate affection overmuch, foorthwith (as though he would ſtrive againſt the ſtreame) he forced and endevoured himſelfe to ſhewe a ſmiling countenance in his talke, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a ſingular mildenes in all his actions: and if it happened at any time, that he were much mooved, he would drawe a bucket of water and ſet it by the welles ſide a good while without drinking of it, &amp; by this means bridled his deſires, &amp; acquainted them by this manner of dealing (even as a good father doth his children) patiently to endure, when as theſe thinges are denied them that they require. In like manner when as we perceive that this chollericke humour within, and many occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, doe prick and ſpurre vs forward to anger, we muſt then, as it were, muſter all our forces together, the better to defende our ſelves,<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Plato. Plutarch in his diſcourſe, why God deferreth the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the malefactors.</note> and couragiouſly reſiſt the violence that is offered vs. <hi>Plato</hi> having taken his man in a great fault, was of a ſodain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly mooved, and having gotten a cudgell as though hee woulde have beaten him, notwithſtanding deſiſted, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no further puniſhment.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23951:78"/>which ſeemed to rebell againſt him, and would no longet bee ruled by reaſon. In like manner ſhould we doe, when as we are troubled with this paſſion, and get either a knife or a ſworde to cut the throate of it, when it beginneth and is as it were in his infancie: for we may eaſily at the firſt oppoſe our ſelves againſt it, as againſt a tyrant, and not permit it to haue rule over vs, but if we ſuffer it to increaſe and to fortifie it ſelfe, it will by little and little over-rule vs, and at length become invincible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> having made a lawe againſt adulterie,<note place="margin">The ſecond remedie is, to quench anger aſſoone as it is begunne. Plutarch in his Apotheg.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode that after the publication thereof, a certaine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Rome was over familiar with his daughter <hi>Iulia,</hi> which he tooke very grievouſly (as it is likely that a father and ſuch an Emperour as he was, would doe) who for the hatred he bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſiune, had very lately made a ſharpe and rigorous lawe againſt it: and therefore on a day he meeting this gentleman by chaunce, ſtroke him with his dagger vntill he cryed out, that there was a lawe made whereby he ought to bee puniſhed: wherewith the Emperour was ſo aſhamed and ſo mooved with him ſelfe, that he was ſo farre tranſported with Choller, that hee would neither eate nor drinke all the day after. If we would thus correct anger, and aſſoone as we perceive it with draw our ſelves from all company, as thoſe doe who have the falling ſickeneſſe, to the ende that others ſhould not ſee them fall groveling and lye foming at the mouth, ſhewing a moſt ſtrange and gaſtfull countenance, we ſhould not often doe thus, but we ſhould eaſily tame this furious paſſion, and at length attaine ſuch a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſtancie of minde, that it could not be altered with any occaſion whatſoever. The <hi>Thebanes</hi> thought at the firſt that the <hi>Laoedemonians</hi> were invincible, &amp; therfore durſt notmeddle with them, but after that they had overcome them once or twice, then they thought they were able to conquere them: &amp; to ſpeak truly, it was very eaſy for them ever after to overcome them, and that in ſet battels. In like manner if wee once take heart, and thinke that we are able (beeing well armed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) to meete anger in the fielde, and overcome it, we ſhall not neede to encounter this enemie twiſe, for he will not be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as appeare the ſecond time, or if he doe, it will be to his vtter overthrow and confuſion.</p>
               <p>

Let vs conclude then againſt the common opinion, that it is much better not to bee ſo chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke and haſtie, and that this deadly poyſon of anger profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs nothing, which foorthwith wee vomite out with great perill and daunger.

It ſeemeth vnto vs at the firſt, that if wee have once vttered our anger, our mindes are ſatisfied: ſo doeth the covetous man thinke, that if he once obtaine that hee deſireth, hee will then reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23951:79"/>poſſeſſion and increaſe of riches which hee deſireth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augmented more then it was before: ſo likewiſe the poyſoned ſtomacke of the other is nothing eaſed by outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and furious ſpeeches, but rather they become more frowarde and perverſe. For that rotten humour, that is to ſay, the paſſion which ingendreth theſe diſeaſes, remaineth alwayes in the ſecrete corners of the heart, though the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie thereof bee ſomewhat aſſwaged, ſo that the olde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is eaſelie renewed, as wee ſee it often happen in tertian or quarterne agues.</p>
               <p>Beſides the remedies above mentioned,<note n="3" place="margin">Patience a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedie againſt anger</note> there is another excellent preſervative againſt this frowarde inclination, and that is Patience. For the cauſe why wee are ſo ſoone angrie, is, that wee are verie impatient, and the skinne of our mindes is ſo tender and thinne, that every little jerke with a twigge, that is to ſay, every triffling worde that diſpleaſeth vs, will fetch blood. But if we were as wee ſhoulde bee, we would bee like the fyne golde, and ſuffer our ſelves to bee ſixe or ſeven times tryed in the furnace, and yet the heate of the fire ſhoulde never chaunge our nature, no nor yet our colour;<note place="margin">Apt and fitte ſimilitudes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> and wee woulde reſemble good corne, firſt to bee thraſhed with the flayle, and then winnowed in the winde, and yet bee neither broken with the one, nor carryed away with the other.</p>
               <p>We woulde endure both winter and ſummer like vnto trees planted by running brookes, whome the firſt hurteth not by his froſtes &amp; colde, nor the ſecond by his heate and drought, &amp; as ſheepe that be ſhorne every yeere, and in the ende be ledde to the ſlaughter, and ſuffer our throates to bee cut without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one worde: wee would bee like incenſe, and permit our ſelves to be throwen into the fire, the more evidently to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the faith which God hath given vs: and to bee ground as the muſtarde ſeede, the better to ſhe we our goodneſſe, and ſuffer the plowers to plowe vpon our backes, and to make long furrowes, as the Propher <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">Pſal. 129.</note> Wee woulde be like vnto a ſhippe that is well made and ſufficiently trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, neither the mightie windes, raging waves, or ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie tempeſtes ſhould make vs leake, and like vnto the Palme tree, which though it bee mightily loaden, never bendeth.
<pb facs="tcp:23951:80"/>And to conclude, we would endure (following the example of the auncient writers) to have our skins beaten, and ſtrerched as drummes, without breaking: and as our Saviour <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> to be whipped, mocked, and crowned with thornes, yea and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified too, and yet pray for our enemies who have done vs all theſe harmes. If we wore once armed with this corſlet of proofe, (I meane patience) not onely words &amp; iniuries, which are but as the points of litle thorns, ſhould not pearce vs: but alſo the ſharp arrows of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his lances &amp; pilies ſhould never be able to touch vs to the quick. What is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſe that we are ſo prone to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? is it not becauſe we are diſarmed &amp; ſpoiled, as it were, of this excellent anchor of patience? which notwithſtanding is moſt fit and ſeemely forall Chriſtians. For what faith, hope, or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can we have without it? how ſhal we otherwiſe endure temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and be able to mortifie the luſts of the fleſh? What co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence ſhall wee have with Chriſt Ieſus and the reſt of his Saints? what markes and badges of a Chriſtian? what teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Goſpell? how ſhall we be knowne to be members of Ieſus Chriſt and children of his Church, or that his word hath beene received by vs, and laid vp in our hearts, there to take ſuch deepe roote, that it neede neither feare the Sunne by day nor the Moone by night, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh? How ſhall we (if we be ſo impatient) be knowne to be regenerated creatures, or that wee will renounce our ſelves to follow Chriſt Ieſus, and to take vp his croſſe vpon our ſhoulders, and, as it were, to bee tied to it ſo long as it pleaſeth him to ſuffer it for the confeſſion of the trueth and the glorie of his holy name? who will thinke that we have beene converſant in the reading and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the holy Scriptures, if we be not patient? ſeeing that the end why they were given vnto vs and revealed by the holy Ghoſt, and gathered ſo diligently by the Prophets and Apoſtles is to inſtruct vs, and to ſet before our eyes the example of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men in former ages, at ſuch time as God tried them with great temptations which he ſent them, and by ſo many faire promiſes which he hath made, to take vs into his protection, and to aſſiſt vs whenſoeuer wee call vpon his holy name, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs, to comfort vs, and to accuſtome vs to endure all things.</p>

Which beeing conſidered by the Authour of this diſcourſe, he doth very aptly in the next place, ſhewe the coherence and difference of theſe two perturbations of the minde, and evidently ſheweth wherein this paſſion exceedeth all the reſt going before: this being done, he painteth it out in his colours; firſt in generall, in that envious men are enemies both to God and man, as appeareth in the examples of <hi>Cain, Saul, Ioſephs</hi> brethren, and others of the Iewes. In particular he deſcribeth the hypocriſie, malice, filthines and beaſtlines, into which an envious man plungeth himſelfe: againſt which he oppoſeth the examples of many men, who have beene voide of all <hi>envie,</hi> and among other, the example of our Saviour Chriſt, with a briefe declaration of the profit and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which redoundeth of this conſideration: then hee enlargeth it with the examples of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and of <hi>Alexander Severus:</hi> afterwardes (as ſome painters vſe to cover and

               <p>But it is not ſo with <hi>envie,</hi> for that can not pretend any coule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhewe, but if we be envious, it is at the happie and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate of an other, for which we ſhould rather reioice and praiſe God.

What was the reaſon that the hie Prieſtes, Scribes,<note n="2" place="margin">Of the Scribes and Phariſes.</note> and Phariſes bare ſuch deadly hatred vnto Chriſt Ieſus, which they ſhewed during his life, by opprobrious wordes, iniurious deedes, and many outragious dealings: continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo fiercely, and that after his death, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all meanes to extinguiſh the memory of his name, and to baniſh ſuch as ſhoulde but mention it, or that woulde in any manner or ſort whatſoeuer fauour and defend his honour? What had hee done that did ſo offend them, or might iuſtly prouoke them to ſuch anger? Hee made their blinde to ſee, their deafe to heare, their lame to goe, hee healed ſuch as were ſicke of the palſie among them, hee cured ſuch as were poſſeſſed with wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, hee raiſed vp their dead, he found out that which was loſt, that which was weake hee comforted, hee healed the broken, hee inſtructed the ignorant, and called ſinners to repentance, to the ende that they, acknowledging their faultes, might obtaine pardon: hee comforted the afflicted, and in a worde, hee was the hauen and refuge of all ſuch as were toſſed with the waues of miſerie, and as it were, the ſtore houſe of all the graces, fauours, and bleſſings of God, which are expoſed indifferently vnto all men. Beholde
<pb facs="tcp:23951:85"/>nowe the faultes hee committed, and the cauſes whereby they were ſo eagerly bent againſt him. Wherein we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently ſee, that there is nothing that more offendeth the enuious, then to be good, and that the greateſt fault among them is to be vertuous, to be in fauour with God, and to haue a good opinion among men. Whereupon <hi>Themistocles</hi> was wont to ſay, that the reaſon why no man enuied him, was, for that he had done nothing worthy commendation. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> in like manner, hearing one complaine that hee was hated and ſpited of others, counſelled him, that (to reuenge himſelfe) he ſhould ſtill continue to be vertuous, as the beſt meanes one can haue to puniſh ſuch enemies, whome hee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth, and, as it were, racketh more by his good conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then by all other iniuries whatſoeuer he can offer them.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſtraunge thing to conſider the hatred and mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice that the enuious man beareth to vertue, and how hee is grieued when hee ſeeth it ſhine, as it were, in his neighbours. For albeit that it be profitable and commodious for himſelfe, and that he reape great fruite thereby: notwithſtanding hee is not contented therewith, but had rather loſe the profit he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth by this meanes, then to ſee the other enioy the praiſes and commendations which he deſerueth. Which we may ſee by the Phariſees, who continually ſpake maliciouſly of the doctrine and miracles of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, not for that they were hurtfull or vnprofitable to them, but onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him of the good opinion that the people had of him, by reaſon of his workes, and to defraud him of the honour that was due vnto him.</p>
               <p>Who reaped all the commoditie and profit of the wiſdome and prudent gouernment of <hi>David,</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23951:85"/>when he ſaw the daughters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſing ſongs in his praiſe ſeeing him returne with <hi>Goliahs</hi> head vpon his ſpeare.<note n="4" place="margin">Of Ioſephs brethren.</note> What an exceeding commodity and profite was it for <hi>Iacob,</hi> his children, and whole family, that God had purpoſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſuch honour and dignitie? for otherwiſe they had beene in danger (as in proceſſe of time it euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) miſerably to haue died with hunger and famine. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſetting behinde them all the pleaſure and commodity which they might participate of, by their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aduancement, deſired rather, (through an enuious and malicious ſtomacke) to ſee their brother die, yea, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to kill him, and thereby endaunger them ſelues, their children, and their good father, then that (through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bountie of God) he ſhould attaine vnto ſo high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrement.</p>
               <p>By this, one may perceiue,<note place="margin">The nature of the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and their hypocriſie.</note> that the enuious man is no leſſe grieued at the ſight of vertuous and well diſpoſed men, then is the Panther when he ſeeth the face of a man, which (as <hi>Saint Baſil</hi> ſaith) is ſo diſpleaſing in his ſight, that hee no ſooner ſeeth the picture thereof, but incontinently he rageth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth by all means to ſpoile and teare it. It is true, that the envious man doth neuer in ſuch ſort diſcouer himſelfe. But indeauouring to obſcure the honour of other men, hee vſeth ſome pretext and colour, and by all meanes ſeeketh to hide his malicious ſtomacke: as appeareth by the Iewes, who to cloake the ſpite and mallice they bare vnto Chriſt Ieſus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting him before the iudge, ſomtime accuſed him that he was a blaſphemer, ſometime that he was a ſeditious fellowe, and a moouer of tumults among the people, and ſuch like accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by this meanes the better to hide their owne cankred ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to make him odious among the common ſort, and to prouoke the magiſtrate againſt him. Notwithſtanding though that the hatred and rancour, which the envious bare towarde the vertuous, bee ſo coloured and disfigured, if it were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the enmitie which is betweene Egles and Dragons, or that betweene the Crowes and the Owles, the Cocke and the Lyon, the Boare and the Elephant, betweene
<pb facs="tcp:23951:86"/>whome (it is reported) there is ſuch diſcord and hatred, that euen when they are dead their bloods will in no wiſe bee mingled together: ſo likewiſe enuie and vertue can in no wiſe agree. Hee that will be in fauour with the enuious man muſt needes bee vicious. For ſo long as God is good, (which is and ſhalbe for euer and euer) and that through his great and exceeding mercie, he ſhall beſtow many and great graces among his children,<note place="margin">Envie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</note> to enrich and beautifie them: and as long alſo as there ſhall be any in this world, who deſire to liue vertuouſly and honeſtly, this paſſion will alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the deuill, and in the heart of all ſuch, as are in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh eſtate and condition vnder him, gnawing them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and feeding vpon them as an impoſtume or filthy vlcer. By reaſon whereof the auncient Philoſophers haue likened vertue to the ſunne. For as the heate thereof ſofteneth waxe, and hardeneth the myre: ſo likewiſe vertue reioyceth and comforteth the good, and grieueth the wicked, conſuming and waſting them by little and little, and ſo at length pineth them away with ſorrowe and griefe, in ſeeing good men flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in wealth and proſperitie.</p>
               <p>It is like vnto the moth in the garment, the worme in the tree,<note place="margin">Fit compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to proue that envie conſumeth it ſelfe.</note> the ruſt on the iron, which firſt conſume thoſe things that haue ingendred it.

               <p>Enuious men (as the olde ſaying is) are not onely like vnto vipers, in that they be alwaies full of poyſon, but alſo for that neither the one nor the other can bring foorth their young ones without killing them ſelues: and they differ in nothing but in this, that when as the young vipers are hatched, the old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently die, whereas malicious men conſume by little and litle, as men pyned in priſon, or waſted with a long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

Which ſurely is a worthie commendation for kinges, and ought to bee hereditarie, and as it were, the proper and true patrimonie of all great ſtates, who can not haue a more goodly ornament to beautifie themſelues, and ennoble their houſes, nor a more notable blaſon in their armes, to verefie their nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, nor (to conclude) a more ſhrill trumpet to ſounde out their praiſes ouer the face of the whole earth, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them vnto the ends of the world, then to be ſuch louers of vertue and knowledge, and to honour theſe giftes in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they find them.<note place="margin">Contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Princes, who haue hated vertue.</note>

                  <pb facs="tcp:23951:90"/>for the contempt he had of all good learning,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 8. cap. 13.</note> and the hatred and mallice which he bare thereto, in that hee baniſhed all the learned men out of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, terming them in deriſion the rattes and vermine of his Court. Whereat we neede not to maruell, conſidering hee was ſo ignorant and ſo fooliſh, that he could not ſo much as write his owne name: and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as we daily ſee is a deadly enemy to vertue.<note n="2" place="margin">Of Ateas.

                  <hi>Adrian</hi> had many goodly and commendable partes in him,<note n="4" place="margin">of the Emper our Adrian.</note> and was one of the beſt furniſhed with knowledge and vnderſtanding of all the Emperours of <hi>Rome:</hi> but this was all obſcured with the hatred that he bare vnto all them, who

He diſſembled this thing for the time, as though he had not heard it: notwithſtanding, hee was inwardly ſo offended and ſo vexed, that his opinion was reiected as well of the maſters of the arte as alſo of the Emperour, that afterwardes he (comming to the Empire) put the poore man to death, for no other cauſe but this, that he would not yeeld vnto him, in that vvhich was moſt vnreaſonable and contrarie to knowledge.</p>
               <p>Although theſe former examples bee moſt execrable,<note n="5" place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt example of enuie in Commodus, written by Dion, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius, and others.</note> yet are they nothing in compariſon of that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Commodus,</hi> vvho notvvithſtanding his education and bringing vp by the moſt famous and wiſe men, which vvere in all the vvorld, and the diligent care of his father <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> the wiſeſt and moſt vertuous prince that euer was, and the goodly patterne of honour and vertue, vvhich vvere ſet before his eyes in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of fiue Emperours his predeceſſours: and finally the graue
<pb facs="tcp:23951:91"/>and wiſe admonitions, which hee had dayly of the truſtie and faithfull counſellours of his late father, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo vicious, and ſo vnruly in all his actions, that hee exceeded all his predeceſſours and ſucceſſours in miſchiefe, and eſpecially in enuy, which was in him in moſt abundant maner, which may euidently appeare if we conſider two or three of his actes. When it was tolde him that <hi>Mamertus Antonianus</hi> was very like him in proportion of bodie and magnanimitie of minde, hee cauſed the party that tolde him this, forthwith to bee ſlaine, and likewiſe within a little after, hee murdered his couſin <hi>Antonianus,</hi> alledging, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed not any man in the worlde to compare him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much leſſe to reſemble him. And it is further reported of him that he poiſoned <hi>Sulpicius Craſſus</hi> the Proconſul, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Proculus,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Lucanus,</hi> who were the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for that hee vnderſtoode they were honeſt men, gouerning the countreyes vnder their charge prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iuſtly. But the moſt infamous and wicked part of all other reported of him, is, that of the fourteene or fifteene Romane gentlemen, who were ſporting themſelues vpon the bridge of <hi>Tyber</hi> (for hee paſſing that way and meeting with them, demanded of them what they were talking of: whereto they anſwered, that they had beene diſcourſing of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who after his death had left an euerlaſting ſorrowe to all poſteritie, for the loſſe of ſo good and vertuous a prince) for which, without any further proceſſe of Law, hee cauſed them to be throwen into the riuer, ſaying, that no man could ſpeake well of his father, but he muſt needes ſpeake euill of him.</p>
               <p>Who is there,<note place="margin">No enuie in any other creature but in man who hate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> that abhorreth not ſuch men, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch mortall hatred, is not aſtoniſhed to conſider that euer their ſhould be any ſuch creatures, though indeede their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo wicked and ſo corrupt, that there is no impietie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, which is not ſometime inherent in them: for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of them is ſo exceeding, that there is no kind of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, but they are ſubiect vnto it. There is no imperfection or vice whatſoeuer in other creatures, which man participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23951:91"/>not of, and which is not common to him with them: and if there be any vice that man hath proper and peculiar to himſelfe, ſurely it is enuie, which is neuer found in beaſtes, for that they haue not the reaſon and vnderſtanding to diſcerne the happie and proſperous eſtate of others. Which is the cauſe that ingendreth hatred and enuie among men. And as there is no enuy but among men, ſo doe they alwaies vſe it one towardes another. We doe not enuie an Oxe for his ſtrength, nor a Peacocke for that he is more gay then wee are, nor Apes for their nimbleneſſe, nor ſerpents for ſubtilty, nor doues for their ſimplicitie, nor any other creatures for thoſe qualities that are in them. There is nothing but the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of other men that vexeth vs: and eſpecially of our friends, neighbours, kinred, equals and familiars. For we neuer enuie ſtrangers and ſuch as wee know not, nor the poore man euer enuieth the Prince: but the potter the potter (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſayeth) the fiſher the fiſher, the huckſter the huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the marchant the marchant, the gentleman the gentleman, the ſcholler the ſcholler, the ſeruant the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the young man the young man, the olde man the old man, the ſouldier the ſouldier, the Lawer the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Doctour the Doctour: and to make ſhort, wee ſee that ſuch as ſhould vpholde and maintaine one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either for their ſtate and condition, their yeeres, their neighbourhood, their kindred and acquaintance, are vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet together by the eares through this curſed paſſion: and it breedeth commonly much debate betweene great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages if they bee neighbours, and diſſolueth the knotte of vnity betweene brethren, if they conuerſe long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And this appeareth notably in the examples of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael, Lot</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Iaakob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Ioſeph</hi> and his brethren, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and in olde time the <hi>Parthians</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> among whome, there was neuer firme friendſhippe, nor ſure vnitie by reaſon of this curſed enuie, which euer brake the bandes that ſhoulde haue tyed them together. And
<pb facs="tcp:23951:92"/>it ſeemeth that this was the principall cauſe,<note place="margin">Why God hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the loue of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> why God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Lawe that one man ſhould loue another, there is a ſpeciall remembrance made of our neighbours, and ſuch as inhabite neare together. For though that of our ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any commandement, we ought to loue them, by reaſon of the proximitie and acquaintance wee haue with them, and that therefore one would thinke, hee had more neede to haue commended, yea and commaunded the loue of ſtrangers: yet notwithſtanding conſidering that which wee haue ſpoken touching the perverſneſſe of our nature, which for the moſt part maketh vs to hate our neighbours, more then any thing elſe, hee hath eſpecially mentioned them in his Lawe, therein expreſſing the malicious and cankred cogitations of our hearts, ſeeing that wee are more ſauadge and cruell herein, then the bruite beaſts.<note place="margin">Beaſts not ſo ſauadge as man is.</note> For they being but a little acquainted and vſed together, doe liue quietly without moleſting one another: as we may ſee by cattes and dogges, who liue quietly together and ſeldome or neuer fight, vnleſſe it bee, when as the one know not the other. But the firſt that we will be ſcratching and clawing, if we may catch them, are either our neighbours, or our next kinsfolkes.</p>
               <p>Enuy then,<note place="margin">A briefe ſumme of this firſt diſcourſe againſt enuy.</note> as we may ſee, among all other creatures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth choice of man, and among men, of neighbours, and of them the moſt vertuous, againſt whome it oppoſeth it ſelfe without all diſcretion.

And as we ſee all brightneſſe offenſiue vnto thoſe, who haue ſore and diſeaſed eyes, ſo likewiſe there is no light of the minde or vnderſtanding, which doth not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly vexe, and as it were gnaw the heart of the enuious, when as he conſidereth his neighbours honour and glory, thinking that his owne is wholly obſcured, as are the moone and the ſtarres by the ſunne ſhining. By reaſon whereof, euen as when we ſee our neighbours houſe which, by reaſon of his greatneſſe and ſtatelineſſe, bereaueth vs of the ayre and proſpect, we wiſh that either it were cleane pulled downe, or at the leaſt aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo likewiſe, the enuious men woulde willingly, that the aduantage that their neighbours or familiars haue of them, vvere taken away, and their ſailes leſſened, for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23951:92"/>that by their greatneſſe they thinke them ſelves diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>We have hitherto declared what manner of paſſion this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſecond part which diſcourſeth of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt envie, and of the comfort thoſe ought to have who are envied.</hi> 1 <hi>The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</hi>
                  </note> and howe farre it eſtrangeth vs from God, (whoſe image ſhould alwayes lively appeare in vs) and howe neere it coupleth vs with the devill. Nowe it remaineth briefely to ſet downe ſuch remedies as are convenient to avoide it, and withall the comfort and conſolation that God and vertuous men ought to have, when they are ſpited and hated. As concerning the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Saint Baſill</hi> hath ſet downe two; the firſt is, that we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider the frailtie and vncertainetie of riches, honour, pleaſure, and other delightes of the worlde, which are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the cauſes of the hatred we bare towardes our neighbours. For if we repute them (as in deede they are) vaine and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and conſider with our ſelves the care, paine, danger, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure they drawe with them, we would rather pitle them who poſſeſſe them, for that they bring ſo much miſerie, then ſpite and malice them, for ſo ſhort and troubleſome a felicitie. After that <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the tyrant was driven out of his kingdome,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Timoleon.</note> 
                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> meeting him on a time at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whither he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired after his fall, in the preſence of many philoſophers, among whome he was ſporting after his accuſtomed manner, tolde him that nowe he beganne to ſpite and envie his eſtate, to ſee him live ſo quietly: meaning, that povertie, by reaſon of the reſt and quietneſſe wee have thereby, is more to be envied and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then all the riches of fortune, which as lightning in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuddenly, doeth nothing but dazell the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
               <p>The ſecond remedie is,<note n="2" place="margin">The ſecond remedie.</note> that we conſider that the graces and giftes of our neighbours are common to the whole Church, and that it is given them not to the entent they ſhould be lordes over them, (for from God alone doeth every good gift pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and he ought to be reverenced for them) but as good and faithhfull ſtewardes to diſtribute and devide them among ſuch as have neede of them. If we would thinke of this, wee ſhould have no great occaſion to mallice them but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we would thinke we were greatly bound to love them and their wiſedome, for that they take great paine to keepevs, and to beſtowe vpon vs thoſe good thinges, which God giveth vnto
<pb facs="tcp:23951:93"/>vs by their meanes, and if it happen that (as vnfaithfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of an hoſpitals, who but too often robbe the poore men over whom they are placed) they will retain any thing vniuſtly, of that which God hath given them to diſpence vnto ſuch as have neede: yet in ſuch a caſe we ſhould be ſo farre from Envie, that on the contrary we ſhould exceedingly pitie ſuch poore thieves, which expect every day when the Iudge ſhould ſende them to hanging, by reaſon of their theft and robberies, and for that they have bene ſo vnfaithfull in their dealings.</p>
               <p>Nowe as concerning the comfort that a man ſhoulde have that is ſpited:<note place="margin">A comfort vnto him that is ſpited. The firſt comfort.</note> He muſt firſt hope, that if he perſiſt conſtantly in the ſtudie of vertue, it will daily ſo increaſe, that at the length it will weaken envie, and ſo diminiſh it by little and little, that in the ende it will quite exſtinguiſh it. For as we ſee the fire in the beginning caſt foorth a great ſmoke, which quickely vaniſheth away as ſoone as it is well kindled: ſo likewiſe vertue cauſeth great mallice and ſpite in the beginning, but if a man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and will not be diſcouraged, but burneth more and more in vertue and goodneſſe, in the ende he ſhall diſperſe them, as the Sunne beames driveth away the cloudes, in ſuch ſort, that at length we ſhall not knowe what is become of them.<note place="margin">The ſecond conſolation.</note> He muſt alſo comfort him ſelfe in that which <hi>Saint Gregorie</hi> hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that as God by a wonderfull and an vnſearcheable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell hath accompanied our malladies, diſeaſes, loſſes, povertie, and all other afflictions whatſoever with a kinde of compaſſion and naturall pitie, to the ende that our neighbours taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of our infirmities, ſhould ſomewhat aſſwage the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, and by this meanes, as it were in ſome ſort, helpe vs to beare &amp; ſuſtaine the burthen of them, ſo alſo that in thoſe particular bleſſings he beſtoweth vpon vs, he vſeth envious men as a meanes to bridle vs, that wee ſhould not exalt our ſelves too high, and that this preſumption, if it be not brideled, ſhould not be the occaſion of our ruine and deſtruction. For the two extremities (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) doe prejudice as well the bodie as the minde. If one drinke or eate, ſleepe or labour too much, it hurteth the corporall health which can not be preſerved, but by a mediocritie in all thinges: ſo likewiſe may we ſay of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23951:93"/>minde, which ſurely is not in health, if it be either too hautie, proude, or preſumptuous, or too baſe, lowe, and ſubmiſſe. To the ende then that it may be well diſpoſed, it muſt bee kept in a mediocritie, and, as it were, in a meane betweene both, to the ende that it may be ſtrong ynough to beare adverſitie, and ſo heavie, that it be not blowen away with a puffe of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, which is a verie difficult thing as we may daily ſee by experience, for we doe no ſooner thinke of adverſitie, but wee are by and by throwen downe and diſcouraged: and a little proſperitie will make vs carrie all our ſailes. And therefore God hath ſet envie on the one ſide, and pitie on the other, as it were two places to reſt on, in the high way, to the ende that if wee will exalt our ſelues in proſperitie, Envie ſhoulde bee readie to pull vs downe, and if wee be too much diſcouraged with adverſitie, pitie and compaſſion ſhould be readie to helpe vs vp.</p>
               <p>Wee may gather hereby that God vſeth envie,<note place="margin">What profit God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of envie for the good of his children.</note> as thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> vſed their Oſtrociſme, for by their Lawe and auncient cuſtome of the countrey they baniſhed the richeſt, and moſt renowmed men of their Common wealth, and ſuch as had borne greateſt offices, and by their prudent and wiſe manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their affaires had gotten greateſt authoritie: not of a raſh or headie conceipt, or thorowe ingratitude, and a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruing of their good ſervices and famous actes, and much leſſe for any crime or fault committed by them: but onely by this meanes to moderate their greatneſſe, and to hinder them, that their ambition ſhoulde not growe to the height of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, and by this meanes to reſiſt it in the beginning, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe growing too great, the courſe thereof would not bee ſtopped without great trouble and effuſion of blood. In like manner God ſuffereth good and vertuous men to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied and vexed, not for any harme hee beareth vnto them, nor for any deſire he hath to puniſh them for their ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but onely by this meanes to keepe them from preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pride, whereto we are verie much enclined, when as we conceive in our mindes, that we are better and more fortunate then other men.</p>
               <p>And thus much haue I thought good to ſpeake touching the

Which we can not well doe, vnleſſe we vnderſtand the hinderances that vanitie caſteth in our way, to the ende that they being taken away, we may the more eaſely paſſe to the place whither we would. To helpe vs forward as much as may be, the Author diſcourſeth in this fifth booke of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and especially of that kinde of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> which we ought especially to eſchewe: and the better to make vs vnderſtand his meaning, he devideth <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure partes. The firſt ſort of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is honeſt, good, and laudable, which in fewe wordes he paſſeth over, as having a purpoſe to ſtande longer vpon the other. Then he commeth vnto thoſe which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, wherein he refuteth thoſe, who through too great auſtereneſſe condemne them as vnlawfull: conſequently he confuteth the Stoicks, and entreth into a diſcourſe of affections, and especially of Ioy and Sorrowe: of which having ſhewed the right vſe, hee condemneth in the third place the Epicures and ſundrie other hypocrites, enemies vnto naturall pleaſures. This being done, he entreth into the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe pleaſures which are vicious. Hee placeth in the firſt rancke the gluttons and the drunkardes, whoſe wickedneſſe he plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcovereth, and oppoſeth againſt them the frugalitie of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, whereof he ſetteth downe many notable patternes, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="tcp:23951:95"/>in many tragicall examples cauſed by theſe venemous pleaſures. Then he maketh an invective againſt the exceſſive cheere vſed at tables, ſhewing the diſcommodities that theſe delicates bring both to bodie and ſoule; prooving withall that ſobrietie both in eating and drinking is moſt neceſſarie for the preſervation of this life, and the attaining of a better life: and that the diet of heathen men ſhall be a condemnation vnto Chriſtians, whoſe faultes he likewiſe deſcribeth. Next vnto this, he anſwereth ſuch as preferre their taſte before their health, and thoſe who alledge they may doe with their own what they liſt: and other, who reprehend cuſtome, and ſuch as blame the reformation of exceſſe, tearming it a curious and exceſſe noveltie; and this cauſeth him to paint out and ſet foorth in their colours, the vanitie and diſſoluteneſſe of theſe times: and becauſe it is but labour loſt to preach vnto full bellies, who are not ſo quicke of hearing beeing full, as they are when they are emptie, he exhorteth Princes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates carefully to looke to their offices: and to encourage them, he ſetteth downe many notable examples, as thoſe of <hi>Moyſes, Ioſua, Ezechias, Ioſias, Eſdras, Conſtantine the great,</hi> many of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and ſundrie Kinges of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe for that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are nouriſhed by companie, and that when the bellie is full, the bodie would be at reſt, (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe ſaith, and as experience teacheth) he entreateth of the ſecond troupe of wicked pleaſures, that is to ſay, whoredomes, whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe he diſcovereth, in that they bereave vs of our vnderſtanding, kill the bodie and waſte our goods, which is prooved by ſound reaſons, worthie examples, ſitte ſimilitudes, and choice ſentences, annexing hereto an excellent treatiſe of the goodneſſe of God towardes his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when as he exerciſeth them with croſſes and afflictions, and to make theſe damnable pleaſures more odious, he ſheweth alſo what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular miſchiefes enſue of them: as the brutiſhneſſe and ſottiſhneſſe of ſuch as are in ſlaverie vnder them, the ſeparation with <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> arenouncing of the love of God, to plunge them ſelves into a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie puddle which maketh them madde, enemies of vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is amplified at large: whereby wee may ſee that it is not without cauſe, that God hath declared that he will iudge whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and that ſuch as wallow in that ſinne have noparte in his grace and favour.</p>
                  <p>Having thus lively painted out the diſcommodities of this kinde
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23951:95"/>of pleaſure, thereby to withdrawe ſome men, and to bring them vnto a better vnderſtanding, he ſetteth downe certaine remedies. The firſt whereof is, as it were a table and a picture of pleaſure, thereby to make it the more odious. The ſecond containeth an enumeration of Gods iudgements againſt pleaſure, and ſuch as have bene voluptuoſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The third ſheweth the miſerable ende of ſundrie particular men. In the fourth he ſetteth downe what puniſhments God hath laid vpon Princes and Magiſtrates, who have favoured or ſupported ſuch lewdneſſe, not forgetting among other memorable ſtories, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Scedaſus,</hi> and the deſtruction of the Lacedemonians. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he ſetteth downe other teſtimonies, and bewaileth the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of many cities which are yet in flouriſhing eſtate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth Princes to reforme ſuch diſorders, ſetting downe the meanes howe to doe it, that is, that firſt they ſhould reforme them ſelves, that they baniſh idleneſſe out of their courtes, and aboliſh Tavernes out of their countries, and ſuch other ſchooles of ryot, as alſo all other baites of lightneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe. Finally, that they carefully take heede, that they keepe the trueth which teacheth men to know their ſinnes, and imprinteth in their heartes a deſire to live according vnto Gods lawes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſort of pleaſures are ſuch as are vnprofitable and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whereof he ſetteth downe ſome, and conſequently applieth foure remedies to heale them, who are overmuch infected with ſuch vaine paſtimes, as in the ende displeaſe and hurte thoſe which followe them. In concluſion he teacheth with what affection all vertuous men ought to vſe the affaires of this worlde, and howe they ſhoulde employ their riches, and governe them ſelves.</p>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may inferre, that there whereas the ſuperfluitie which is
<pb facs="tcp:23951:97"/>vaine and vicious in any thing, is eſchewed, we ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the honeſt pleaſure which we may reape of the creatures without any diſhonour vnto the Creator: ſeeing that in every one of them hee hath not placed both, without great reaſon and iuſt cauſe, but by this meanes making an ample and large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his goodnes, he would giue vs occaſion continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to praiſe and honour him.<note place="margin">Against Stoikes and Epicures.</note> Wherefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> iuſtly blamed them, who placed felicitie and vertue in this, to be without affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſhewing in deede that it lieth in the moderation of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whereby he condemneth as wel thoſe who through their blockiſhnes and ſtupititie, are without al affection: as thoſe alſo who through an vnbridled &amp; diſſolute life, let looſe the reyne, &amp; follow their appetites whether ſo ever they will lead them. And out of doubt it is impoſſible, if we be not mooued with pleaſure, that euer we ſhould be ſtirred with griefe and ſorow: and who ſo euer they be that will haue ſuch flintie and braſen hearts, it is not likely that they are verie mercifull, though not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this is the principall vertue which men ought to haue, if they will be perfect and followe the example of our heauenlie father, vvho vvould haue vs (in the aduerſities which hee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth either to vs or to our neighbours) haue ſome feeling of their ſorrowes, to the ende wee may bee patient in our owne griefes, and pitifull in thoſe of our brethren and acquaintance: on the contrarie, when as by his grace we or they proſper, that wee reioyce, to the ende to declare by our ioye, that we envie not the proſperitie of other men, nor bee proude of our owne good happe.</p>
               <p>And what ſhould become of vs, if we were without all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Would there be a man that would applie himſelfe to any thing? for pleaſure and griefe doe rule all our actions, and there is no man, but either affecteth or eſcheweth things, for the one or the other, which God in creating and framing our natures hath ordained, and that ſuch affections ſhould ſerue our minds, as coches doe our bodies, to carrie them whether our delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conducted by reaſon, doth carrie vs. For as wee ſee in the ſea, that if the windes blowe not, the ſhippes are conſtrained to lie ſtill, and cannot ſtirre from the place where they are: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our nature, if all affections ceaſe, can not, nor ſhall not be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23951:97"/>able to turne either to the right hand or to the left, no more then if we were in a palſie, which taketh away the vſe of our whole bodie. And this is the reaſon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato in</hi> Philebo.</note> why <hi>Plato</hi> called them the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes and ſtrings of our mindes, giuing vs to vnderſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they ſerue for the opening or ſhutting, lifting vp or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing dovvne: and generally for the mooving of euery part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, euen as the bodie is mooued and guided by the ſence: and further, that they are the occaſions of feeling, and almoſt of all the knowledge we haue, in ſuch ſort,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his treatiſe of moralvertue.</note> that vve may iuſtlie name them (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth) the handles of Philoſophie, by the which children take hold, who would neuer loue it, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions it giueth, if they had not ſome ſparks, as it were, of ſome ſhame, deſire, reputation, ambition, pleaſure, or ſorrowe, which ſtirre them vp thereto: and they being conducted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it were, by a good ſchoolemaſter, are very vvilling to goe to ſchoole, and learne vvith all diligence.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay,<note place="margin">A ſtoicall obiection.</note> that theſe affections are alſo the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that vve fall into many vices, and that if there vvere no loue, there vvould be no louers, no more then there vvould be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men, if there vvere no deſire of riches; vvhich may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: and further, that by reaſon of the corruption vvhich is in our hearts and vnderſtanding, they rather provoke vs to vice, then to vertue. But vvhat? muſt vve cut off the legge,<note place="margin">An anſwer.</note> becauſe it halteth, or the noſe becauſe it is oftentimes full of filthie matter? they vvho vvill take avvay all affections of nature, becauſe they doe allure vs vnto vice, doe as hee did, vvho maintained, that vve neuer ought to ride poſt, for that ſome oftentimes catch ſhrevvd falls; or that vve ſhould not ſhoote in a gunne or a bovv, for that both gunners and archers often miſſe the marke; or that vve muſt not ſing, for that ſometime vve fall into diſcorde. If a man be afraid leaſt he ſhould be drunke, and that the fume of the vvine ſhould aſcend vp into his head, and ſo diſquiet him, let him mingle his vvine vvith vvater, and thereby mitigate the ſtrength and heate thereof, and by this meanes hee ſhall prouide, not onelie that it doe not hurt him, but alſo that it profiteth him much, in that it quickeneth and cheriſheth him. So muſt vvee doe likevviſe if vvee feele

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23951:99"/>houſe ſo ever he came, were it into the Kings pallace, or the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars cottage, were hee in ſilkes, velvets, friefe, or ruſſet, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies kept a <hi>decorum,</hi> and a comelines in his behaviour, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuch a Philoſopher as he was.

And in thus doeing, a man that ſhall moderately and wiſely enioy any honeſt pleaſure, as God ſhall give him occaſion, giuing thankes vnto him and acknowledging his goodnes, ought much more to be commended, then he that refuſeth this grace and favour, depriving him ſelfe of thoſe giftes, which God hath given and offered him. For he doth it either through contempt, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a deteſtable pride, thinking him ſelfe to be more wiſe in reiecting, then accepting the goodneſſe which GOD hath offered.</p>
               <p>We have now ſpoken ſufficiently of naturall pleaſures,<note place="margin">Here he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the diſcourſe of wicked plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> and now we will handle other delights, and begin with ſuch as are naught and vicious: whereof ſome are touching the mouth and bellie, and ſome others not farre vnlike vnto theſe.</p>

It is for that (ſaith he) we may conſult the better of our affaires, and leaſt if we ſhould buie too much wine, wee ſhould be conſtrained to begge our counſell of other men. And it is a very rare thing to ſee drunken men ſo well adviſed, as of them ſelves to aske counſel of other men For they cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to heare but with much adoe,<note n="3" place="margin">They take away our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> though it be offered them: and when as any friende they haue doe tell them of any thing, they doe contrarie to their reputation and credit, they are either angrie with them, or els laugh at them. And this was the reaſon, why <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Cenſor</hi> was wont to ſay, that it was loſt labour to talke of vertue to the bellie, or goe about to perſwade it: for that it hath no eares to vnderſtand that which one ſaith, eſpecially if you goe about to bridle his deſires, or to rule his expences. Theſe are ſwine (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid) which deſire nothing ſo much as to fatte them ſelves,<note place="margin">Math. 7.6.</note> and then to wallow in their filth at their eaſe and pleaſure.<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.14. <hi>They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the health of the bodies.</hi>
                  </note> For that (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) they care for nothing in this world, but to fill their bellies. Behold now the ſtate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſo drunkards minds are, whoſe bodies ſurely are not much better in the end, if they proceed on as they begin. For by reaſon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23951:100"/>they ſurcharge and overlade their ſtomackes, and for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration either of the quantitie or qualitie of their meates, they devoure whatſoever commeth next to hand as their appetite deſireth, it is impoſſible but that there ſhoulde follow many raw &amp; cold humours, &amp; that their bodies being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with corrupt &amp; putrified matter, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> become diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the gout, other have the falling ſicknes, others palſies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Apoplexies, ſome red eies, others rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teeth, &amp; ſome a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king breath, &amp; to conclude, their members &amp; partes of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies become weake, and trembling in their ioyntes, and that in ſuch ſort, that one would iudge them to be the ſonnes of <hi>Cain,</hi> (as <hi>Saint Baſill</hi> ſaith) for that they are the inheritours of his paines and torments.<note place="margin">In his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon against drunkennes.</note> And it is a wonder (as the ſame holye Doctor ſaith) that their bodies which are made of earth and clay being thus diſtempered, bee not wholly reſolved, and that falling by pieces they become myre and dirt. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſooner extinguiſheth the naturall heate, nor that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the radicall humiditie wherewith it is nouriſhed, nor to be ſhort, that ſooner withereth the beautie, vigour, and ſtrength of youth, then exceſſe and gluttonie. And what is the cauſe that the diſeaſes and the medicines are ſo multiplied in theſe latter dayes, that beſide all the remedies and meanes which have bene taught in former times, and the moderne inventions for the preſervation of mens lives, notwithſtanding they are ſhorter and more fraile then ever they were? It is evident that the worlde fadeth apace, and that being nowe in his olde age, can not beget ſuch ſtrong and luſtie children as it did in his luſtie yeeres, and that the earth, which is wearie of bringing foorth, can not nowe yeelde ſuch ſavourie and wholeſome fruite, as it did in the beginning for the nouriſhment of them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the principall and chiefeſt reaſon that we are ſo weake and ſo full of diſeaſes, and that in fourtie or fiftie yeeres we are ſo feeble and ſo broken, is our intemperance and riote, both in eating and drinking.</p>

There is no man but may eaſily ſee, that the ſparing and frugall life of the one ſort with their painefull and laborious induſtrie, and the idleneſſe of the other with their ſumptuous and coſtly bellicheare are the cauſes of this diverſitie among them.

By this we may eaſely geſſe what this lickerous and daintie diſh was: as alſo of that which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> one of their Kinges did among the <hi>Tharſians.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Ageſilaus.</note> For as he paſſed thorowe the countrie with his armie, the Magiſtrates and principall officers among them, in token of their grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the benefites they had received by him, and his favour towardes their Common wealthe, ſent him great ſtore of all ſortes of fruites, plentie of veniſon, meale and cakes, and many other rare dainties that they had in ſtore, and great aboundance of ſtrong and delicate wines which were made in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: which after he had verie thankefully accepted, hee onely reſerved ſtill the meale for the foode of his ſouldiers, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reſt to ſuch as had ſent it, ſaying that ſuch things would not pleaſure him any thing at all, but when as they would needes preſſe him to take all, he commaunded in their preſence to give the overplus to the ſlaves and varlets of his armie, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to the ende they ſhoulde not thinke hee diſdained their giftes) that ſuch delicate diſhes, as were fitte for nothing but to provoke newe appetites,<note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of great estates in theſe dayes and thoſe of former times.</note> were meeter for ſlaves then for men of a free eſtate and condition.

Which thing the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> conſidering, allowed nothing vnto their cookes, but ſalt and vineger: ſaying, that the reſt conſiſted in the meate and in the paines taking. For there is no reaſon that the tables ſhould bring our appetites to vs, but that we ſhould bring our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks to them: and it ſhould be ſufficient for the bourd, to offer that which may ſuffice vs: for as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaide, there is no meate more dangerous, nor from which we ought more charily to keep our ſelues, then that which bringeth hunger with it, when as in deede we are not hungrie, and drinke that maketh vs thirſtie, when as in truth, we are not drie.</p>

For it is moſt certaine (as <hi>Saint Baſil</hi> ſaith) that the throat of ſuch liquorous and drunken fellowes, is like vnto a ſwift currant, where the water continueth not long, and as ſoone as it is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the channell is forthwith as drie, as though there neuer had beene any water in it. And as concerning the qualitie of the pleaſure, it is very leane, and (as the Poets ſpeake of their loue) it is ſweete and ſowre. And if thoſe who haue made triall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would confeſſe the trueth, they would reſemble it to thoſe, who ſcratch too hard where it itcheth: and in a word, that it is rather in imagination, then in eſſence and in deede: for it alwaies draweth with it a marveilous vnquietnes both of bodie &amp; mind, &amp; encombreth the naturall diſpoſition &amp; inclination. Wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dependeth the eaſe, ſtrength, and alacritie of man. <hi>Plutarch</hi> (the more liuely to decipher this) propoundeth a moſt proper &amp; apt compariſon. Even as (ſaith he) there is a kind of tickling in the fleſh, which cauſeth laughter, that is both vncomely &amp; vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; like vnto a convulſion &amp; ſhrinking of the ſinews; ſo likewiſe all thoſe pleaſures of the bodie, which are prouoked onely by fantaſie &amp; conceit of minde, are ſottiſh, feeble, troubleſome, and farre differing from nature: and it is a cleere caſe, that the greateſt nomber of thoſe, who ſearch for nothing ſo much as delicaſies in their ſauces, are ſuch; &amp; they rather eate &amp; drinke of cuſtome, then
<pb facs="tcp:23951:108"/>of any neceſſitie: and glutting them ſelues after this manner, they depriue them ſelues both of the pleaſure and profit which they ſhould enioy, if they would vſe the creatures of God aright. And this is the reaſon that the bread, which of it ſelfe is ſo ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, taſteth not in their mouthes, vnleſſe it be ſophiſtically vſed, and that the cookes by ſome ſorcerie haue metamorphiſed the naturall taſte, and giuen it ſome other ſauour, either ſtarke naught or at the leaſt nothing ſo good, as it was before. For nature ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth art in euerything, &amp; God is more expert in ſeaſoning thoſe things which he hath created, then the cunningeſt man who ſo euer. And here that may fitly be applied which <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his treatiſe, why God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his iudgements.</note> who ſeeing him ſelfe by hunger and thirſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yeeld to his enemies: and afterwards being permitted to drinke a little water, crying out on the ſodaine, and ſaying: O God, how much to blame am I, that for a litle delight, haue loſt a long &amp; an exceeding great felicitie? So likewiſe all drunkards &amp; liquorous perſons, ſhould thinke them ſelues that for a ſmall pleaſure, they would take out of ſeaſon, which alſo is full of gall and bitternes, they looſe their naturall delights; as quiet &amp; ſweete ſleepes, a quicknes in their ſences, a merineſſe of heart, a good diſpoſition and an abilitie of al the parts of their bodies, al which they enioy by abſtinence and ſobrietie.</p>
               <p>There are ſome,<note place="margin">An anſwer vnto ſuch as thinke that their goods were giuen them to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to ſpend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prodigally.</note> who thinke ſufficiently to excuſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, for that they are rich and wealthie. Howe ſhould wee ſpend our reuenewes (ſay they) if we ſhould not liberallie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our friends? as though God had giuen them their wealth only to this end: and as though there were no poore men in the world, and that there were no other meanes to trie their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: as though they could not poſſible be charitable towards the needie, but were conſtrained to be diſſolute and prodigall: as though the table were the foundation of friendſhip, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt place to ſhut vp friends togither. As though (to applie that vnto them, which <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſaid of himſelf &amp; of his children, after they were baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Athens)</hi> all their goods were loſt, if they them ſelues were not loſt with them. Theſe men make me remember them, who aske how they ſhould ſpende their times, if it were not at tennys, or at cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and making of loue: as though there were not many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23951:108"/>exerciſes more honeſt, and more profitable, wherein ſo precious a thing as time is, may be better ſpent.</p>
               <p>We know all the meanes that may be to gather riches,<note place="margin">The extreme miſery of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall men.</note> and yet we can not learne one way how to ſpend them. Let euery man iudge if it be not true which I ſay: that is, that theſe men of whome I haue ſpoken, doe more willingly and ioyfully ſpend a hundred, yea two hundred crownes yerely, if they haue them, in banquetting and chearing, then they doe a hundred ſhillings in comforting the poore and needy, who craue it at their hands for Gods ſake. And that it may be ſo, they inuite one another to their houſes, yea, and they are very angry, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bidden they refuſe to come. But if they be neuer ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated by the other, to relieue them in their extreame neede and neceſſitie, to giue them but the hundreth part of that which they ſpend riotouſly they will in no wiſe agree to it, vntill they be euen compelled thereto by their long and earneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Which doeth notably bewray their affections, and what deſire they haue to helpe one another. But I wonder they are not aſhamed ſo to profane the holy and ſacred name of friendſhip, which if it be ſure and firme, can haue no other foundation, nor be by any other meanes retained, then onely by vertue: or that they are not afraid to offer ſuch great iniury to their friends, as to account of them, as of flatterers and claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes, who can not otherwiſe be retained, but with traynes and baites.</p>
               <p>And yet I will not condemne the laudable cuſtome that Chriſtians vſe often times in viſiting one another:<note place="margin">What ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhoulde vſe.</note> but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is onely, that the great preparations which are commonly vſed at our feaſts and banquets, may be reformed: for that (in my opinion) they are very ſcandalous among Chriſtians, and are a principall occaſion, why that diſcipline, which ought to be among them, is ſo corrupted. And it is certen, that if our friends be vertuous and well giuen, they will be content with <hi>Pythagoricall</hi> banquets: and if they be otherwiſe, we may ſay with <hi>Socrates,</hi> that a litle is to much for them. That great king <hi>Cyrus</hi> being demanded what ſhould be prepared for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, anſwered, nothing but bread, for that he would ſuppe by the riuers ſide. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being come to one of his friendes
<pb facs="tcp:23951:109"/>houſes, purpoſing in friendly manner to dine with him: and ſeeing ſuch great preparation was made to entertaine him, made a very ſhort returne, ſaying, that hee euidently percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that all which was prouided, was not for his dinner: but rather that he had entended to offer ſome great ſacrifice to the gods, ſeeing hee had prouided ſo great cheere. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caeſar</hi> being entertained with ſmall cheere, and a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dinner, tolde him that had prouided it, ſecretly in his eare, that before that time hee neuer knewe him to be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar a friend. If we had honeſt friendes, and wee our ſelues were ſuch vertuous gueſts, we would neuer finde fault with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and frugall diet: but with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> acknowledge wee loue them ſo much the more, for their familiar and friendly entertainement.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">Whether it be a thing vnbeſeeming rich men to liue ſparingly</note> it were an vnciuill and an vngentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thing, that a man, who hath great reuenewes, ſhould bee ſo exactly gouerned at his table. For anſwere whereof, I will alledge nothing, but that which one of the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſaide vpon the like occaſion: that is to ſay, As a cooke greatly faileth in his arte, who hauing plentie of ſalt by him, would needes therefore put more in his pottage then is ſufficient to ſeaſon them: ſo likewiſe, doeth hee erre groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who reſpecting nothing but his abundance, will needes haue more meate at his table then is ſufficient, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or for others who ſit with him. And ſurely let vs bee as ſparing as wee may, yet doe we oftentimes paſſe the bounds of ſobriety: and ten to one there is ſomething ſuperfluous. Moreouer, there is no greater ciuilitie then that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of vertue, and within the limits hereof all honeſtie is bounded. And to conclude, if wee affect glory and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, wee ſhould rather ſeeke it in moderate abſtinence, then in ſuperfluous riot. But our peruerſneſſe is ſo great, and our affection ſo diſordered, that we are not barely contented to be vicious, and to glory in our naughtineſſe, but wee will needes diſgrace and blame vertue which contrarieth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, and ſo make it more contemptible, hindering others from going forwarde in goodneſſe, who are backewarde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already. And this maketh vs call honeſt ſobrietie
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23951:109"/>by the name of niggardlineſſe, and a godly reformation of life, wee account hypocriſie and diſſimulation: and in a word, wee terme wiſdome, cowardlineſſe; zeale, raſhneſſe; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, obſtinacie; iuſtice, cruelty; magnanimitie, boldneſſe and preſumption. There is no vertue, but that which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with our affections, neither yet any vice, but that which is contrary and repugnant to our deſires.</p>
               <p>There are others,<note place="margin">Againſt ſuch men who to excuſe their exceſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cuſtom.</note> who thinke to defend themſelues againſt reaſon, with alledging cuſtome: who neuer conſider, that by this meanes they ſeeke to eſtabliſh the moſt cruell and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyrannie, that euer was. For if it bee tyrannicall to make lawes contrarie to reaſon, onely vpon a ſelfe will, what ſhall wee ſay, when as we execute them and continue them cleane repugnant to the lawes of God, and all good order? I would demaund of them, if it were ſufficient for a thiefe to defend his robberies to alledge cuſtome? Or to murtherers, and whoremongers, to ſay, that they haue bene giuen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted thereto euen from their cradles? If wee muſt allowe of things by cuſtome, nothing were more allowable then vice. For this is one of the moſt auncienteſt thinges that is. It began by and by after the creation of the worlde, and hath continned and multiplyed euer ſince vntill this day: at which time, it is more ſtrong and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then euer heretofore. But notwithſtanding, wee are ſo farre from being able to prooue the goodneſſe thereof by cuſtome, that as good and honeſt things, the more ancient and the more allowed and practiſed that they haue beene in former times, the more commendable they are at this day: ſo likewiſe thoſe things, which in their natures are naught and diſhoneſt, by how much the more ancient they are, and authorized by time and continuance, and ſo may claime, as it were, preſcription: by ſo much the more damnable and wicked are they to be deemed and accounted.</p>
               <p>The laſt and finall reply,<note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as condemne all reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder pretext of noveltie.</note> which is vſually made when as this matter is debated, is a demand or queſtion in ſaying who would leaue the old faſhion for the new? and thus euery one watcheth other, and expect who ſhall begin firſt. But I would gladly know this: whether we be as long in committing faults, as we
<pb facs="tcp:23951:110"/>are in conſulting how to amend them. And whether that which God hath commanded, and which is conſon ant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is pleaſurable and profitable ſhould be diſputed and conſulted of. And is it not great pity, that if the queſtion bee mooued of any folly or lewdneſſe, there ſhould be ſo many to aduance and ſet forward themſelues, and euery one ſtriuing to gaine the victorie of that, whereof there is no other guerdon but ſhame and confuſion, and which is continually accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with wofull repentance: and that there ſhould be ſo fewe, and thoſe ſo backward and wayward to follow vertue, of which we may be ſure to reape great gaine, and moſt ample recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence?</p>
               <p>We are like vnto thoſe harebraines, and deſperate aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,<note place="margin">A deſcription of the most ſort of men, who at this day glory in the name of Chriſtians.</note> who are as valiant and hardy as <hi>Sampſon</hi> or <hi>Perceforest,</hi> to beate and breake open a poore countrey mans dore, to ſteale his hennes, to rauiſh his daughters, and to filtch and pilfer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath in his houſe: and in other things ſo fearefull and cowardly, that being in the warres, they tremble at the ſound of euery trumpet.

And albeit theſe great afflictions are ſent of God, who by his puniſhments would make vs acknowledge our faultes, to the end we ſhould turne vnto him in all humility and reuerence, that ſo he might be appeaſed towardes vs, and forgiue vs our ſinnes. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there are few that thinke of this, and none that (to auoide his iudgements) will doe otherwiſe then they haue beene accuſtomed.

His friends and counſellers, to the end to diuert him, would deuiſe no meanes to effect his deſires, nor he himſelfe could imagine how to compaſſe ſo great an enterpriſe, conſidering the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and reſiſtance that <hi>Lucinius</hi> and <hi>Maxentius</hi> would make, who were his conſorts in the Empire, and both mortall and deadly enemies to Chriſtian religion: and ſuch alſo were almoſt all the ſubiects of the Empire, who did exceedingly deteſt it, for that it condemned all the religion of their forefathers. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, contemning all danger whatſoeuer, and reſpecting neither warre nor any rebellion of his ſubiects, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commended his eſtate, himſelfe, and gouernment, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his affaires into the hands of almightie God, he fell to put in execution, that which he had purpoſed, and that ſo happily, that his enemies being ouerthrowne and vanquiſhed, and that in a ſhort ſpace, hee raſed and pulled downe all the holdes of Sathan, that is to ſay, his Temples and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of Idolatrie, aboliſhed their ceremonies, diſſipated their conuenticles and ſynagogues, diſprooued and diſcouered their errours, and did ſo blaſon the abuſes and abominations of their Prieſtes, that in ſhort time euery man began to abhorre them, and preſently hee called the poore Chriſtians, out of woodes, out of deſarts, out of holes, &amp; caues, wherin they were hid during the fury and perſecution of the tyrannicall Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who were before him; giuing them commiſſion to build Churches in all the townes and cities of the Empire, which ſhould be dedicated to the honour of God, to the preaching of his worde, and the adminiſtration of his ſacraments, which he hath ordained for the confirmation of the faith of his choſen and elected children. And for that they were poore and had all their goods confiſcate, he cauſed them to be reſtored by an edict and decree of the Senate: and furthermore commanded, that in thoſe places where there were great aſſemblies, there ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:23951:113"/>certaine ſummes of money deliuered vnto them, out of the common treaſury, to the end they might be the better able to defray their ordinarie charges and expences, about their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires; the which went ſo proſperouſly forwarde by the meanes of this good prince, the diligence of his ſeruants, and the bleſſing of God, that in leſſe then ten or twelue yeeres, in ſtead of thirty thouſand gods, who were receiued, allowed, and worſhipped by the <hi>Romanes</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> reporteth) there was but one God, who was acknowledged and publikely adored in all the Empire: and in ſtead of a million of patrons and gods of protection, whom euery man inuented as his fancy ſerued, there was no more left then one only Chriſt Ieſus, to whom euery one yeelded his obedience, confeſſing and acknowledging, that he was the onely path-way to righteouſnes, grace, ſaluation, life euerlaſting, and all kinde of happineſſe and felicitie: and that there was no other, vnder whoſe protection they might ſafely and ſecurely reſt &amp; repoſe themſelues.</p>
               <p>Who is there that will not acknowledge, that, in all then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of this worthy Emperour,<note place="margin">The example of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that nothing is impoſſible vnto thoſe, who reſolue with them ſelues to ſerue God.</note> their appeared a manifeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance &amp; bleſſing of God, which made euery thing ſo eaſie: quite againſt the opinion of thoſe, who in the beginning would haue examined this action with worldly wiſdom?

And yet notwithſtanding God, in whome he repoſed his whole confidence, ſhewed him ſo great mercy, and ſo fauoured his zeale, that he was not long before he builded him a temple, whoſe foundation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained almoſt 3 parts of the earth, which was habitable.

And finally, the pity which he had of the whole Church, which was ſo great, that to deliuer it from that miſerable and wofull oppreſſion wherein it was, by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of cruel tyrants, he doubted not, after the example of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Maccabeus,</hi> to abandon him ſelfe and all that hee had, to moſt imminent daungers and extremities.</p>

               <p>And to returne to our former ſpeech, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence (by occaſion) we haue ſomewhat digreſſed,<note place="margin">The beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt drunkenneſſe &amp; gluttony, is chaſtitie: by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he entreth into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſuch like: and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the miſchiefes that enſue of them.</note> we muſt vnderſtand, that beſides thoſe conditions wherof we haue ſpoken before, which may be reaped by ſobriety, there is alſo another moſt excellent one, &amp; that is, that ſhe teacheth vs the way to chaſtity. For that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh is moſt true, that whoredome &amp; diſſolutenes are hatched by drunkennes: &amp; therefore in the end of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he firſt exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reform their tables, before he giueth any order for their bodies: teaching vs thereby, that all vncleannes of life, do proceed of exceſſe &amp; gluttony. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet likewiſe ſearching out the cauſe of the iniquity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> doth attribute it eſpecially, vnto the abundance of the cuntry, &amp; the plenty of all delicacies in their cities, by reaſon of the fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoyle where they were planted. But before we goe any further in diſcourſing of the cauſes &amp; occaſions of this kinde of pleaſure, it is conuenient to ſet down ſome of the miſchiefes and miſeries wherein it wrappeth all thoſe, who follow &amp; hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. I ſay ſome of them, for that it were an infinite labour to repeat them all, and in my opinion nothing neceſſarie: for that if we haue but a ſmal ſparke of reaſon &amp; ſound iudgement,<note n="1" place="margin">It taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vs into bruit beaſtes.</note> thoſe which ſhalbe alledged, wil be ſufficient to withdraw vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue &amp; liking of it. Firſt of all therefore, it taketh away our hearts (as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith) that is to ſay, it doeth ſo dull our ſpirits, that we become ſenceleſſe, and ſo cooleth the heate of our willes, that wee growe careleſſe and negligent, and as dull to followe any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23951:114"/>vertuous endeavour, as if we were dead, and without life. And beſides the taking away of euery good motion in vs, it depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs alſo of all reaſon and vnderſtanding, and ſo wholly transformeth vs into bruit beaſts. And vpon this occaſion began the fable of <hi>Circes,</hi> whom, the poets (in declaring the operation of hir ſorceries and inchantments) ſaid to haue changed men into ſwine, &amp; to haue bereaued them of all knowledge and loue of vertue, if they did but once kiſſe or behold her.</p>
               <p>There is a certaine fiſh, which the Latines cal <hi>Torpedo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An excellent compariſon &amp; fit for the proofe of this firſt miſchief cauſed by whordome.</note> which we terme ſlouthfulneſſe, not for that it is ſlow in motion, but by reaſon of a ſecret vertue and hidden power that it hath: for being chaſed by the fiſhermen or by any other fiſh, ſhe caſteth forth a certaine venemous poyſon, wherewith nature hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for her owne defence, which hath force to ſtay euery thing that is infected therwith: benumming all the ioynts and ſinewes in ſuch ſort, that they ſtir no more then if they had bin ſmitten with the palſie: &amp; it proceedeth further: for being caſt and ſpred abroad in the water, where the nettes are laid to take her, if the fiſhers chance to come &amp; put their hands into the water before the force be paſt, forthwith they become numme &amp; ſtiff, &amp; they can not ſtirre them. Wherein ſurely the nature of pleaſure is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liuely repreſented: for if we will hunt after it, for that there ſeemeth to be ſome delight &amp; happines in it, or for ſome ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſweetnes which we hope for by the fruition thereof, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it benummeth both body &amp; mind in ſuch ſort, that the one can not deuiſe or imagine any good thing, neither can the other put it in practiſe or execution. Which may be very eaſily proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the hiſtories and examples of all times.</p>
               <p>But there is one among all the reſt,<note n="2" place="margin">The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Salomon a moſt notable proofe.</note> that (in my opinion) is moſt memorable, and worthy to be conſidered of euery one, the better to driue them from this whoriſh and filthy affection. And that is the example of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who had receiued ſo many ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fauours &amp; ſingular graces of God, that he was, as it were, the wonder of wiſdom, knowledge, induſtry, piety, faith, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, iuſtice, magnanimity, mildneſſe &amp; ſobriety: beſides, he had ſuch worldly happines &amp; felicity, that in glory and magnificence he was like vnto another Sunne: notwithſtanding he was ſo bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; enchanted with this pleaſure, that forgetting both God,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:115"/>himſelfe, and his duty, he was not aſhamed to abandon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; publikely to worſhip Idols, &amp; to build temples for them hard by that, which he before had erected to the honor of God, &amp; to ſacrifice to ſome of thoſe gods whom his concubines ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and adored. Who would euer haue thought that ſuch a man, who (excepting Chriſt Ieſus) was the beſt furniſhed of any that euer was in the worlde, and knew moſt perfitly the craft, cunning diſſimulation, flattering vvordes, teares, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite dealings of all diſſembling vvomen, ſhould euer haue bene ſo deceiued and abuſed, that for to pleaſe his ſtrumpets, vvould diſpleaſe God, deſtroy his ovvne houſe, and ſo villanouſly ſtaine his glory, vnleſſe he had bene out of his vvittes, &amp; drovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it vvere, in moſt extreame and bottomleſſe follies?

Wherby it is moſt manifeſt what force pleaſure hath, which in ſo ſhort a time wrought ſo great an alteration. For though that in reſpect of the ſexe or kind, he was alwaies the ſame: notwithſtanding, in regard of his idlenes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaſie and eaſe, wherto he was wholy addicted in his latter end, he might wel be termed a woman. Seeing that princes, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues to be ſo corrupted &amp; effeminated by the pleaſures of the fleſh, are ſo named by the ſpirit of God in the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi> According to which ſaying, an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Philoſopher returning from <hi>Sparta</hi> a city of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp; being asked fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he came &amp; whether he would, anſwered, that he came from a city of men, &amp; was going to a towne of women, taxing thereby the pleaſure of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> wherewith they were ſo effeminated and weakened, that they had no more valour and force then women and Eunuches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth in his book (entituled of the fortune of the <hi>Romanes)</hi> that the goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> purpoſing to goe viſite the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> left her glaſſe, her girdle,<note n="5" place="margin">The liuely picture of whoredome making men beaſts.</note> and other womaniſh attire vpon the banke of the riuer <hi>Eurotas,</hi> which ranne by their city, and tooke a ſworde and a buckler in her hand, and with ſuch furniture and equipage preſented her ſelfe before <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and the other citizens, knowing full well that otherwiſe ſhee ſhould neuer haue beene welcome among painefull and induſtrious people. But if they would haue her goe from them, and dwell at <hi>Cyprus, Paphos,</hi> and in other places where ſhee was honoured, and adored, ſhee muſt (if ſhee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to bee welcome) leaue off her armour and labour, and take to her againe her perſumes, her muske and ſweete odours, and in ſtead of a valiant and ſtout warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhee muſt become a fine, tender, and delicate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And this diſordinate and carnall pleaſure doeth not only turne vs into women, but alſo it transformeth vs into beaſts, as wee haue ſaid before. Which the poets did couertly ſignifie by their <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> &amp; changes of many men, ſome into cowes,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:116"/>others into dogges, ſome into hogges, and ſome into trees and hearbes. All which fables tend onely to this end, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that this voluptuous humour doeth forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue vs of all ſence and reaſon whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was taken with the loue of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>

The vigour of his ſpirit (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith) died in him &amp; departed to go liue in the body of his loue. Though hee had the halfe of the Empire vnder his gouernment, &amp; therefore by all likelihood an infinite number of matters to diſpatch, yet would he not regard them: neither yet heare the Embaſſadours that came to the Court, neither prouide againſt the ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of his enemies, neither yet any preparation for his warres, nor ſeeke to preuent the dangers he was like to fall into, no nor yet would hee ſpare ſo much time as to entertaine his friendes and allies. He ſtudied for nothing day nor night, but to pleaſe his miſtreſſe: and ſo captiuated his minde, and brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into ſuch ſlauery, that hee could not beſtow one houre of his liberty to ponder of his affaires. And this did not appeare onely in him, but alſo in all other voluptuous kings and princes, as in <hi>Sardanapalus, Balſaſar, Ptolomie, Phiſcon, Caligula, Nero, Commodus, Heliogabalus, Galienus,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who hauing opportunity to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their pleaſures, prooued men of no reputation, without any great ſpirit or counſell, and of no execution whatſoeuer.</p>

O Lord God, is it poſſible that

               <p>It ſeemeth vnto me, that theſe things being conſidered,<note place="margin">The great miſerie of whoremaſters and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons prooved by many ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplet.</note> the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> had great reaſon to call ſuch as took this courſe, (loſt men.) For how is it poſſible that they ſhould be ſaved, who do ſo lewdly waſte their wiſdom, their reaſon, &amp; all the vigour of their minds, the health of their bodies, their gold, ſilver, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and oftentimes the countrie that hath brought them forth. <hi>Diogenes</hi> meeting <hi>Speuſippus,</hi> who was going to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie</hi> in his coach like a minionly gentleman, and by his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and effeminate countenance declared his diſordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his pleaſures, paſſed by him without ſeeming to know him; which when <hi>Speuſippus</hi> perceived, he diſcovered him ſelfe by ſpeaking aloud, &amp; ſaying, all health to thee <hi>Diogenes;</hi> &amp; none to thee, (ſaid he:) for it is apparant by thy doings that thou doeſt not deſire it. We neede not wiſh health, peace, and proſperitie vnto ſuch as care not for it: and ſuch are theſe voluptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for the way which they take, and which ſeemeth ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, pleaſant, broad, large and ſpatious, leadeth them to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Christ</hi> ſaith. <hi>Terence</hi> in his Comedies being deſirous to ſhewe vnto young men the nature and the ende of pleaſures, to the intent they ſhould take heed leſt they be deceived by them, called them by the name of Calamities, that is to ſay, waſters and deſtroyers: to give vs to vnderſtande that, which we dany finde to bee moſt true by experience, that whereſoever they fall, there is nothing but ſpoyle and deſtruction: and that they are like vnto that hayle, which God ſent to beate downe the pride, and loftie ſtomackes of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or rather worſe: for that deſtroyed nothing but that which was abroade in the fieldes, whereas pleaſures deſtroy as well thoſe things which are within, as thoſe things that are without, that is to ſay, both ſoule and bodie, and leaveth nothing vnconſumed.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is that <hi>Antisthenes</hi> hearing one commend a voluptuous and pleaſant life,<note place="margin">A continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> deſired him that he woulde goe and tell that ſweete tale to the enemies of their Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for

And yet to make more manifeſt howe dangerous a thing pleaſure is, <hi>Xerxes</hi> after the reducing of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> who had rebelled againſt him, vnto their former obedience, condemned them to no other paine but to lay aſide armes &amp; the travels of warre, &amp; to regard nothing but give them ſelves wholly to muſick, to play vpon inſtruments, to make great banquers, to court their ladies, to entertaine the time with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant diſcourſes, &amp; to apparel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves gallantly that they might pleaſe their miſtreſſes. Whereby we may conſider, that the King &amp; his Counſell being greatly mooved with the rebellion of the ſaid <hi>Babylonians,</hi> yet knew no better meanes to reduce them to their obedience, to puniſh them for their faults, to keepe them vnder afterwards, &amp; to bind them with the chaines of perpetuall ſlaverie &amp; ſervitude, then to lay the raine in their neckes, and ſuffer them to abandon them ſelves to all pleaſures whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And ſhal we thinke that if it were not a very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous thing,<note place="margin">Seeing that pleaſure is ſo daungerous, God exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnder the croſse, &amp; affliction of the world, leaſt they ſhould periſh with the world.</note> that God would be ſo careful to keep it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his children, who eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world vntill this day (as we may eaſily ſee by hiſtories of former times, &amp; examples of this preſent age) have evermore bin kept vnder the yoke of moſt rigorous diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, &amp; continually exerciſed with paines, poverty, abſtinence, ſicknes, malladies, captivitie, &amp; other kinds of afflictions, in ſuch ſort, that if we wil dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the maner how God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes governed his Church, we ſhall eaſily ſee, that he was not more careful for any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that pleaſure ſhuld not enter ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, &amp; therfore he hath ſuffred it to be ſo miſerably afflicted in all ages: that by this means he might ſtop, as with buſhes &amp; thorns, every gap &amp; paſſage, to keep out this furious &amp; mad beaſt, which differeth nothing from a mad dog but onely in this, that the one doeth ſhed his venime by biting, and the other by kiſſing, and therefore is ſo much the worſe, &amp; more to be feared.

And it was very fitly ſaid of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ſeeing a Courteſan riding into the fields in a coach all covered with velvet, with chains &amp; pearles about her neck, to ſolace &amp; recreate her ſelf, that ſuch a cage was not fit for ſo cruell a beaſt, neither yet that the chains, which ſhe had, were ſtrong ynough to keepe her from doing of miſchiefe.</p>

For ſeeing he is immortal, he can not die; &amp; being trueth it ſelf, he can not lie; &amp; being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſame, he can not change: we neede not feare then, that death will ſeparate vs, or that during life he will be wearie of vs. We ought rather to bluſh &amp; be aſhamed of our ſelves and of our follie, who leaving ſo ſure and certen friendſhip, ſo honourable, pleaſant, and profitable love, wil chooſe another, wherein there is nothing but diſhonour, loſſe, diſpleaſure, ſorrowe, complaint, diſcontentment, feare and diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>Here is yet another point to be conſidered, &amp; that is, that in a ſhorttime we muſt either leave pleaſures, or they will leave vs; &amp; ſhall we not herein acknowledge the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God? for even as the light appearing vnto vs, &amp; the meanes whereby we may know the trueth, if we either refuſe it or diſdaine it, we provoke God to puniſh this our ingratitude, and to give vs over into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſence, whereby not only the means of attaining further knowledge in Gods miſteries, is quite take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vs, but alſo our blindnes is ſtrengthened, &amp; driveth vs forward to ſeeke after lies. In like manner, after God hath offered vnto vs his love, and hath taught vs the way how we ſhould love him, if we violate &amp; offer injury vnto the moſt amiable thing in the world, making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof, he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withdraweth his grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, &amp; abandoneth vs to our deſires, in folowing of which, we begin preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to love our pleaſures, which is the moſt filthie ſtrumpet that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and ſo would ſhe ſeeme even vnto her lovers,<note place="margin">Pleaſure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men madde and furious.</note> if they could ſee her as in deede ſhe is. But the greateſt miſchief of all is, that ſuch as are in pleaſure thinke them ſelves happy, &amp; fortunate; for as the height &amp; perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of follie is, in that we pleaſe our ſelves therewith, &amp; think that we are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous wiſe: ſo indeed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not we be more vnfortunate, then when as we accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our felicitie to conſiſt in thoſe things wherein reſteth our greateſt miſerie: and though we be in moſt wretched eſtate, yet we wil never beleeve it, nor give any credit vnto thoſe who tell vs ſo. <hi>S. Auguſt.</hi> (who in many places hath notably expounded what true happines is) ſaith in his diſcourſe touching the maners of the catholik church
<pb facs="tcp:23951:120"/>that he can not be accounted happie, who can not enioy that which he loveth, neither yet he who hath that which he loveth, if it be hurtfull vnto him, neither yet that man which hath the moſt ſoveraigne and profitable good thing that is, if he love it not, nor care not for it. The reaſon is this, for that thoſe who deſire that which they can not obtaine, are tormented: thoſe, who poſſeſſe thoſe things which ought not to be deſired, are deceived and abuſed: and ſuch as care not for thoſe things that are to be deſired, and ſuch as they muſt needs have if they will be happie, are ſicke and diſeaſed: which can not come to paſſe, but that he to whomſoever they happen, muſt needs be miſerable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it neceſſarily enſueth, that ſuch as deſire to be happie, muſt both love and enioy thoſe things that are abſolutely good. And there is nothing ſo, but God: he is the fountaine, the ſpring, and the original of every good thing which we can deſire: our hope for to ſatisfie our deſire; and therefore we ſhall never be happy before we come vnto him. We muſt not come ſhort, nor we muſt not go too farre; for the one is dangerous, and the other is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous &amp; ridiculous. For that on this ſide of our God, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing firme and ſtable; and beyond, there is not any thing at all. So if we will be vertuous, we muſt followe the meane, as our Captaine and leader: ſo likewiſe muſt we repoſe our ſelves who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, if we will be abſolutely happie and bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then who ſeeke for their felicitie in pleaſure,<note place="margin">Such as ſeeke their felicitie in pleaſure, are enemies to vertue, reaſon and veritie.</note> &amp; thinke to finde it if they may reſt in ioy and delight, are they not farre from their account? yes certenly, and ſo much the rather, for that their mindes being poſſeſſed with this falſe opinion, they are hindered (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) and made vnfitte to receive any perſwaſion which is offered them, to drive this conceite out of their heads, and to make them know wherein true felicitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. For there is nothing more arrogant and vntractable then man, if he be once perſwaded that he is happie, and then there is a certaine kinde of moroſitie and diſdainfull arrogancie, which maketh him vnfit to vnderſtand any demonſtration, be it never ſo plaine and forcible to correct his manners. And this was the reaſon why <hi>Plato,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> being required by the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> (who were a diſſolute people, and wonderfully addicted to their pleaſures) to make &amp; deviſe them ſome good lawes, where with the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23951:120"/>of their common-wealth might be amended; refuſed to graunt vnto their requeſts, though it ſeemed to be a very ciuill and commendable demand, ſaying; it was a hard matter to bring ſuch a nation vnder, and gouerne them by lawes, who by reaſon of their wealth and abundance, accounted them ſelues ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. And therefore <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> teacheth his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> that they ſhould not caſt pearles before ſwine, who haue no other God but their bellies, nor any other felicitie and paradiſe, but to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and tumble in their owne filthines.</p>
               <p>But I pray you, if it were not very bad,<note place="margin">The firſt proofe of the miſchiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named.</note> needed there ſo many examples and reaſons to make men hate a thing, that is of it ſelfe ſo odious, and to induce them to embrace that which is ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? is there any thing ſo full of vnſpeakeable pleaſure, as is our God, who is loue it ſelfe, and the cauſer of that which maketh vs loue his creatures? Let vs a little conſider howe pleaſing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable it would be vnto him, who is the author of all beawtie, comelineſſe, order, excellencie, and dignitie of things what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is in the worlde?

               <p>The beautie of vertue is ſo great (ſaith <hi>Plato)</hi> that if men might ſee it with their eies,<note place="margin">The ſecond proofe.</note> they would be raviſhed with the loue thereof. Then that of God muſt needes (by reaſon) be farre more excellent. For he is the father and patron of all, and yet notwithſtanding both the one and the other haue ſo fewe louers
<pb facs="tcp:23951:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this world, that neither he can get a wife, nor his daughter a husband to marrie her. The Sunne which compaſſeth the earth euery day, inlightning and heating the creatures thereof, hath ſeemed to be ſo beautifull in the eies of ſome, that they haue made an <hi>Apollo</hi> and a <hi>Phoebus</hi> of it, erecting temples, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſacrifices therevnto, and honoured and adored it as a God. And yet the great Sonne of iuſtice and righteouſneſſe, who is the fountaine of all brightnes, can not finde ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as to bee acknowledged of his owne ſubiects, for their Lord, or reuerenced as a father, or heard as a maſter, or adored as a Creator, refuge, and protectour: and yet for all this, that he may draw them vnto him and procure them to doe their dueties, he ſheweth them his power, and imparteth to them of his grace, wiſedome, happines, beautie, and greatnes, ſo much as is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſufficient to make them beleeue that he is perfect, and repleniſhed with all vertue.</p>
               <p>Was not this a ſtrange miſerie and perverſneſſe in our nature,<note place="margin">An amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the former profe, by a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</note> that ſeeing the beautifull and goodly colour which appeared in the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, though it were ſubiect to rottenneſſe, yet wee had ſuch a deſire to eate thereof, againſt the expreſſe commaundement of God, without being afraid of his anger, or to looſe his fauour, from which we are eſtranged by this meanes, neither of the ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we purchaſed vnto our ſelues, looſing his moſt precious and excellent graces, which he had ſo abundantly imparted vnto vs in our creation, neither of death nor euerlaſting malediction, vnto the which wee haue made our ſelues ſubiect, could divert and turne vs from this vnruly and diſorderly appetite? and that on the contrarie, by the incomparable and eternall excellencie of our God, we can not be mooued nor perſwaded by any means what aſſurance ſo euer we haue of peace, of life, ioy, tranquilitie, bleſſing, happines, and felicitie; to the which by this meanes we may attaine. For there is nothing but the brightnes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that can make vs happie, and ſatisfie vs in our deſires. This is that which contenteth the Angels in heauen,<note place="margin">The excellent contentation which Gods children haue in him.</note> which ſo rauiſhed <hi>S.

There is no want of beautie in this face: there is no ſuch thing as maketh other faces verie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and that is vice and imperfection: there can bee no exception: all thinges that are therein are moſt perfect and exquiſite, both in the iudgement of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>Howe falleth it out then,<note place="margin">An other compariſon of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the ſervant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredwith the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the maſter.</note> that there are ſo fewe in loue with God? If any man be commended for his wiſdom, his eloquence, his ſtrength, his paines, or any other vertue, euery man deſireth to ſee him, and we loue him oftentimes before we ſee him. As for example: who is there at this day, that doth not loue <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for his faith, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for his chaſtitie, and <hi>Moyſes</hi> for his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vigilancie, and fidelitie; <hi>Samſon</hi> for his ſtrength, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for his clemencie and curteſie, <hi>Salomon</hi> for his wiſdome and
<pb facs="tcp:23951:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>magnificence, <hi>Elias, Ezechias, Ioſias,</hi> and <hi>Mattathias,</hi> for their great zeale, and likewiſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> for the innumerable vertues that were in him? and if we adore their memories with ſo great reverence, and ſuch ſingular affection; what would we doe if they were aliue againe, and in our preſence? and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe were ſeuerall vertues in each of them, one in this man, and an other in that: and to ſpeake truelie, their was in euery of them but the ſeedes of theſe graces. If then as imperfect as they were, the very remembrance of them is moſt delectable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable; howe reuerent and beloued ſhall the remembrance of our God be vnto vs, in whom they are all vnited and conioyned in all perfection?</p>
               <p>But this is not all our ingratitude.<note place="margin">The third amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which maketh men altogether inexcuſable.</note> For ſeeing that when wee haue ſeene a goodly tablelet, or beawtifull tapiſtrie, we preſently are deſirous of them, and we will giue, we care not what, ſo we may haue them, yea more a great deale then they are woorth, though they be but dead pictures, and that the ſight of them will ſerue vs for nothing, but to pleaſe our eies: ſhall our God, who doth dailie diſcouer his face vnto vs, and offereth vs continually moſt perfect pleaſure, ſhall he (I ſay) be left vnlooked at, or not contemplated of any man? in thus doing, we euidently declare, that either we know not how to make choice of good things, or elſe that we doe not chooſe them for loue and affection. For if it were poſſible to take all the beawtie that is particularly placed and beſtowed vpon euery ſeuerall creature, to the ende to place them all in one bodie: no queſtion but there muſt needs follow a ſingular excellencie, and it would be accounted of in this world, as a miracle. Let vs imagine nowe with our ſelues, that there is ſuch a thing, and that vnto the beawtie hereof, all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, honour, vertue, and perfection, both in heauen and earth, is annexed and conioyned, as in truth all this is moſt apparant in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as he is man, and we can not conceiue any excellent thing, but it is in God in moſt abundant manner. Whereof then proceedeth it, that ſuch a perfection, or a leſſe excellencie by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees, is ſo highly honoured in the creature, and yet it is not admired nor regarded in the Creator, who of all other is moſt perfect? We are like vnto maids which vſually loue the ſeruants better then their maſters: and there is ſome more difference, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23951:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>is the caſe all one. For the reaſon why they loue not their maſters is, for that they are aſhamed to offer any kindnes vnto them, or for feare that if they did, they ſhould notwithſtanding be reiected, or for that if they might attaine it, they thinke it will quickely be talked of and caried abroad. But there is no ſuch danger in louing of our God. For he doth offer his friendſhip vnto vs, and there reſteth no further trouble or danger, then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it: there is no ſhame belonging to it: for it is an honour and credit for vs that we loue him, and he vs: there is no feare: for he can not denie vs, if we once ſeeke his fauour and friende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and hauing once attained that, we ſhall be moſt happie and bleſſed. For as ſoone as hee hath adopted vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that he dwelleth in vs and we in him, according to the old and vſuall rules of friendſhip, he doth participate vnto vs of all his goods and treaſures: he is willing to doe good to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And if he cauſe the raine to fall vpon their ground, and the ſunne to ſhine vpon them alſo, what will he doe vnto his friends? If the riches and plenteouſnes of the mercies of our God be ſo great, and the abundance of his goodnes ſuch, that the very leaſt and worſt of his creatures participate thereof, is it likely that thoſe of his owne familie and houſhold, ſhall want? It may then euidently appeare, by that which haue beene alreadie ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, how profitable, pleaſant, and honourable the loue of God is vnto all thoſe that attaine vnto it, and that is, as many as deſire it: for we may, if he giue vs the grace to will and deſire it.</p>
               <p>But ſome man will ſay; That this is loſt labour,<note place="margin">The fourth amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, declaring the ſtraunge blindnes of voluptuons perſons.</note> and a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing, to goe about to prooue that God is beautifull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable; ſeeing it is as cleere as may be, and ſo certen that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no proofe. Which I confeſſe to be true, and that there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no more words and arguments to prooue his beautie, then there doth to prooue his power, his wiſedome, his eternitie, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other excellencie that is in him, which are as cleere and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as is the light and heat of the ſunne. But to what other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſerueth this replie, then to encreaſe our ſhame? for if he be ſo amiable, that wee thinke it a ridiculous thing, to endeuour to prooue it, for that it was neuer doubted of, why then doe not we loue and embrace him? Wherein wee imitate ſicke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed men, who will confeſſe that the meate which you offer
<pb facs="tcp:23951:123"/>them is very good, yet they will eate none of it: and beeing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked why, they anſwer, that their diſeaſe hath taken away their taſt: ſo likewiſe we muſt acknowledge, that that, which hindreth vs from the loue of God, is the peruerſneſſe of our nature, which doth not onely ſhew it ſelfe to be exceeding great, by reaſon of the feruent deſire we haue to that which is naught, but much more by the ſmall affection wee haue vnto ſo excellent and precious a thing, as this is. How ſhould we loue vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt things, ſeeing we can not loue God, who is the rule and the ſquare to guide vs therevnto? and therefore we muſt not ſay that this is ſpoken to no purpoſe. For it is certen, that we doe not loue God, and wee declare as much by our workes, in that we follow our pleaſures: and it is moſt true, that we can not loue him and our ſelues both together, or that wee lay vp treaſure in earth and in heauen, or that we ſhould liue to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and to our ſelues, or that we be of the worlde and of the Church, or that wee be of righteouſnes and of ſinne, or that both the fleſh and the ſpirite ſhould rule in vs, or that wee ſhould be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light, in doing the workes of darkeneſſe, or that wee ſhould repent vs of our wicked actions, in following our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, or that we mortifie the works of the fleſh, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the filthineſſe thereof: and in a word, that we ſhould loue God, and be loued of the deuill, wearing the liuerie and badges of his ſeruants and ſlaues, by continuing in our pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, obtaining at length the rewarde fitte for ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to giue, which is fearefull deſtruction and horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>We are ſo ſhameleſſe and impudent at this preſent,<note place="margin">Their ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſet down for the fifth amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that we thinke it not ſufficient for vs to be voluptuous, but we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, and make it manifeſt in our wordes, in our talke, in our countenances, in our gate, and in our apparell and attyre: not ſo much but our purſes, our garters, our girdles, and euerie thing about vs, doe euidently declare our affections. We make it manifeſt by the badge that wee carrie, whoſe wee are, and to whome we belong: and to ſpeake truely, we are not ſo afraide of any thing, as that we ſhould be naught, and no man ſhould knowe it. Hee that doth euill, vſually hateth the light: but this is ſo common a thing in our time, ſo vſuall and practiſed of all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23951:123"/>men, that he that will not doe it, muſt auoide the light, and ſhun converſation and companie of men: ſo that the ſhame and feare, which were as two raynes to pul backe our curſed deſires, and to keepe vs in our dueties, are at this day broken and plucked in ſunder.</p>
               <p>And as there is no man, which bluſheth at that which is euill; ſo alſo there are very fewe, which are aſhamed when they are told thereof, or ſhew any diſlike, when as wickednes is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before their faces. And that it is ſo; how many ſhall you finde in ordinarie aſſemblies, which will not laugh at follie and naughtineſſe, and who are not as diſſolute in laughing, as the other in ſpeaking and doing? We are farre from reſembling thoſe yong gentlemen, who being in a place, whereto a certaine bawd had ſecretly brought diuerſe of the moſt beautifull and fine courteſants that could be founde, to trie their chaſtities; aſſoone as they eſpied the ambuſh and deceit, they beganne to hang downe their heads for ſhame, and to looke one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, turning both their eyes and their eares from the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, fearing leaſt otherwiſe they ſhould be ſurpriſed by their beauties, comelineſſe, and entiſing wordes.

And how come theſe ſtrumpets by their iewels, pearles, precious ſtones, and other ornaments, wherewith they are ſoadorned and beautified? wherewithall doe they builde their coſtly and ſumptuous houſes? and howe come they by their rich and antike tables of <hi>

               <p>This is then a wicked marke,<note place="margin">The ſupreme and laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the impietie of voluptuous men.</note> and I knowe not whether it bee a ſigne and token of Reprobation, to commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with ſuch boldeneſſe and aſſurance as wee doe; and to take ſo much the more pleaſure in it, as wee knowe it to bee filthie and diſhoneſt; and to delight in it for the noveltie, as lightlie all laſcivious and voluptuous perſons doe: who are beſt pleaſed with newe pleaſures, eyther in deedes, wordes, ſonges, pictures, and ſuch delicafies. And they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſider, that among all pleaſures there are none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent: eyther all are paſſed away, or elſe to come, and therefore of one ſide there is alwayes griefe, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:23951:125"/>ſide torment. They doe not conſider that all are fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and apparant, and that all the pleaſures of the worlde are as the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaide, like vnto golden pilles, which are ſweete without, but ſo bitter within, that no man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to taſte them. Theſe are dreames, whereof all the pleaſure is loſt as ſoone as we awake. This is like vnto the apple which was ſo good and beautifull in the eyes of our firſt parents, and ſo badde in diſgeſtion. This is a white ſepulchre, which without is fayre and goodly, but within is full of filthie rottenneſſe and ſtincke. This is a ſweete baite, which maketh vs to devoure the deadly hooke that is hid within.

               <p>Pleaſures (as they are reported by our aunceſtours) are like vnto the <hi>Syrenes,</hi>

And this was the reaſon why <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> counſelled ſuch men as would avoyde plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to looke on her behinde, and not before: and that herein we ſhoulde haue ſuch conſideration, as had the governours of <hi>Troy,</hi> when it was debated in publicke Parliament, whether <hi>Helen</hi> ſhoulde be deliuered to the <hi>Grecians</hi> or not.

               <p>There is one moſt memorable hiſtorie of all other, written by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> of a poore man named <hi>Scedaſus,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Leuctres,</hi> and had two very beautifull and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous daughters; he himſelfe was very courteous and friendly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtrangers, though he had no great ſtore of wealth. It fell out ſo, that two <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having often times lodged in his houſe, and being very wel vſed became enamored of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: notwithſtanding they durſt not attempt any thing, beeing helde backe both by the preſence of the father, and by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they bare vnto them in regarde of their vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie: by reaſon whereof they paſſed foorth on their journey without demonſtration or ſhew of any love or affection. At their returne <hi>Scedaſus</hi> being not at home, they found no bodie but his two daughters, who received them with like entertainment as before. Which curteſie of theirs, with their excellent behaviour &amp; good grace in euery thing, ſo increaſed their furious paſſions, that ſeeing them alone, without counſell, without aide or gard of any man, and forgetting the honour, favour and curteous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which they had received at the hands of the father and of his children, the holy and invinlable rightes of friendſhip and hoſpitalitie, the great vertue of their anceſtors, the ſevere lawes of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> againſt adulterers, the ſtraite diſcipline of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, the great fame which was ſpread over all the worlde of the vertue and equitie of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and many other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which might have brideled them, if their luſt had not wholly blinded them, forgetting all this, they violently raviſhed theſe two virgins, and ſpoyled them of their virginitie: yea and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23951:127"/>they did worſe. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they had accompliſhed their wicked deſires, ſeeing them weepe &amp; crie out vnto the gods for revenge, vpon that horrible injurie offred to them, they killed them both, &amp; threw them into a well, and afterwards went home into their own countrie. Not long after the father returning home, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery thing ſaving his two daughters, was long in doubt what was become of them, vntil at length by the miraculous and wonderfull working of God, a little dog which was in the houſe with continual barking, ſometime running to <hi>Scedaſus,</hi> &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the well, which was in the garden, cauſed him to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture as indeed it was: and ſo following this litle beaſt, went to the well to ſeeke for his two daughters, and found them both in the pit, to his vnſpeakeable and exceeding griefe: having pulled them out and buried them, began to ſorow and to be grieved in ſuch wonderfull manner, that al that knew him had compaſſion on him: and as he complained to his neighbours which came to comfort him, one among the reſt tolde him that the two <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> which a little before had lodged in his houſe, had bene there in his abſence, which made him preſently ſuſpect that they had committed the murther, for that they had ſo often commended his daughters, ſaying, they ſhoulde bee happie men that ſhoulde marrie them. Wherefore he determined pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to goe into <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and to make humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the <hi>Ephores,</hi> to doe ſuch juſtice, as the indignitie and horribleneſſe of the fact required. Which when he had done, and finding the ſaid <hi>Ephores</hi> to give him no great hearing, hee went from them vnto the Kinges: and for that they gave him as colde entertainement as the other, hee was conſtrained to returne to the people, and to recounte vnto them the great and intollerable wrong that was offered vnto him: but hee founde no man that eyther woulde or durſt favour him in ſo good a cauſe, by reaſon whereof he ſell in deſpayre, and continuallie running vp and downe in the ſtreetes like a madde man, ſtamped on the grounde, and holding vp his handes to the gods, called for the furies and infernall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to ayde him, and ſo continued vntill his dying daye. Beholde here a briefe narration of the fact, it remaineth that wee vnderſtande the ſequele, and that which happened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes.
<pb facs="tcp:23951:128"/>When as this monſtrous facte was committed, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> commaunded over all <hi>Greece,</hi> and the better to keepe their provinces in awe, had placed Garriſons in everye principall Citie: by meanes whereof the <hi>Grecians</hi> did evidently perceive, that they were ſpoyled of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and tyed to a perpetuall ſlaverie: which thing did ſo wonderfully grieve them, that the <hi>Thebanes</hi> (deſiring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye once, then to live in continuall ſervitude) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnder the conduct of <hi>Epaminundas,</hi> and furiouſly aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cittadel, wherein the Garriſon was, and ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly maintayned the fight, that they overcame them, and ſlewe them every mothers ſonne. This beeing done, they vnderſtoode that the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> beeing greatly mooved with their rebellion, came with all their force to ſacke and ſpoyle their countrey: whereupon they made all preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might bee; muſtered their men, marched forwarde, and mette the enemie at the ſame place, where the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Scedaſus</hi> had bene buryed, and entring the fight did valiantly maintaine the skirmiſh, and in the ende whollye overthrewe their enemies in ſuch forte, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afterwardes able to recover them ſelves. Which made everie man to wonder. For it was a very newe and ſtrange thing, and not heard off before, that they ſhoulde bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed with a leſſe power, ſeeing there was no nation that durſt meete them with equall forces. Here God ſhewed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that hee did well remember the violence which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto the virgins above mentioned, and alſo the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Iudges in puniſhing ſo great a fault. For to make it more manifeſt, when as they were at the greateſt height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in the toppe of all their proſperitie, when as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that no evill could happen vnto them; after that they had bene Lordes of all <hi>Greece</hi> by the ſpace of ſixe or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres, they were by a handfull of people whollie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited and overthrowen, juſt by the grave of the ſaid maids, and by one battell brought to ſuch neceſſitie, and want both of men and of all other neceſſaries for warre, that afterwardes they were never able to defende them ſelves againſt any that woulde aſſayle them. And that which is further to be noted, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23951:128"/>make the iuſtice of God more manifeſt and apparant, is, that <hi>Pelopidas</hi> one of the Captaines of the armie of the <hi>Thebaines,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (a little before the meeting of the two armies) terrified by ſome ſignes which he ſawe in the ayre, which as he thought, did prognoſticate ſome euill lucke; <hi>Scedaſus</hi> appeared vnto him in the night in a dreame, and encouraged him to purſue his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, aſſuring him that it ere were long, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſhould recompence him and his daughters for the wrong they had done them at <hi>Leuctres.</hi> Who will not confeſſe, that in this whole diſcourſe the eye of God is alwaies open, and readie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch wickednes, and his hand prepared readie to puniſh it in due ſeaſon, not onely in them who commit it, but alſo in ſuch Iudges and Magiſtrates, and likewiſe in thoſe common-wealths which tolerate it? And as he wil not alwaies diſſemble our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, if we perſiſt in it: ſo will he not forget our vertues, when as to ſerue and honour him, wee will indeuour to poſſeſſe our veſſels in puritie and holines, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith: and if he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs any authoritie ouer others, to employ it to the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their good manners: as ſundrie good Kings and Princes haue done in times paſt.</p>
               <p>Among other the praiſes and commendations,<note place="margin">Contrarie examples to the former. Ioſias.</note> which the Scriptures giue vnto that good King <hi>Ioſias,</hi> one of the principall (next vnto his pietie and zeale, which he had to eſtabliſh true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) was that he baniſhed thoſe brothel-houſes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the expreſſe commandement of God, had bene erected among the Iſraelites in the time of his predeceſſours.<note place="margin">Conſtantine.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did the ſame,<note place="margin">Theodoſiue.</note> throughout all the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Domitian</hi> alſo, though otherwiſe he was very cruell and vicious, made notwithſtanding very ſharpe and rigorous lawes againſt adulterers. <hi>Adrian</hi> made a lawe,<note place="margin">Adrian.</note> that no man ſhould ſell any women ſlaues vnto ruffians and bawdes, for that ſuch idle varlets are vnworthie of any ſeruants.<note place="margin">Alexander Severus.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> went further, for he draue thein all out of Rome: giuing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to whom ſo euer ſhould finde them like vagabonds, and not occupied in ſome trade to gaine their liuing honeſtly (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one yeere after the publication of his Edict) ſhould take and keepe them for their ſlaues: and if they would not willingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, they ſhould kill them preſently, without incurring any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:23951:129"/>for ſo doing: he commanded further that there ſhould be a ſearch made thoroughout all <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee what nomber of common and wicked women there were, and they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the commiſſioners appointed, whether they intended to amend their liues, or not: and if they purpoſed no amendment, where ſo euer they were found co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting ſuch ſinne, they ſhould be puniſhed with the law of Adultereſſes that is, with death. All ſuch Kings and Princes as theſe were, haue moſt euidently felt the fauour of God, and had great experience of his goodnes in all their affaires. In peace, he inſpired them with wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſell, for the gouernment of their ſubiects: in warre, he gaue them valiancie and courage, to conquer their enemies: and out of doubt, in giuing of them ſo great proſperitie, he plainely declared, how greatly their zeale and loue for the maintenance of publike honeſtie and vertue, did pleaſe and delight him to the ende, that if their ſucceſſors did hope to attaine the like graces, they ſhould be ſtirred vp to follow and imitate their examples. Which is the true and onely means to become equall in honor and reputation with thoſe famous Kings of old time; and to take away ſo many miſeries and calamities, which doe at this day tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and trouble the worlde in moſt grieuous manner: which proceed of nothing elſe but of impietie, iniuſtice, ryot, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes, which are ſo great &amp; ſo apparant, that it is a wonder that the Sunne doth nothide it it ſelfe, to the end it might not ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

                  <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D AMIDES</hi> hearing one commende the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of many Cities at this day.</note> demanded of him, whether that citie deſerued any great commendation, wherein neuer any man dwelled that was the better for it. One may ſay as much as this day, of all the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Europe, which are in any eſtimation. For it is a hard matter for any man to dwell long in them, though hee were an Angel, but he ſhall quickly be defiled and corrupted, there is ſo much leavin and lewdnes among them. Yea it is moſt commonly ſaid of that moſt holy one,<note place="margin">Rome.</note> that there was neuer any man the better for going thither. <hi>Stratonicus</hi> on a time comming foorth of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea,</hi> looked about him whether any man ſaw him, or not: and being asked the reaſon thereof by one of his friends: for that (ſaid he) I ſhould be aſhamed that any man ſhould ſee me come forth of ſuch a ſtewes: ſhewing by this his anſwer, how wickedneſſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23951:129"/>and whoredome abounded in that citie. How many cities (I pray you) are there at this day, to whom this may not very fitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? and I would to God there were not worſe ſinnes then whoredome. But there are other abhominations, and thoſe ſo horrible, that thoſe who haue any feare of God, are afraide to name them, though others be not afraid to commit them. And we muſt not hope for any amendment of this diſorder, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the helpe of Kings and Princes, who ought to be no more negligent in puniſhing theſe ſinnes, then they are in puniſhing murthers, thefts, and common pilferings. For though it ſhould be graunted, that diſſolutenes is not the cauſe of the greateſt part hereof, yet it cannot be denied, but there ſpringeth as much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe from this roote, as from any other thing Furthermore, ſhal we ſay, that they are leſſe diſpleaſing in the ſight of God? if they be, why hath he puniſhed them ſo grieuouſly and ſeuerely in all ages? is it ſo ſmall a matter, to pollute the Temple of God? or to make the members of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> the members of a whore? or to profane our bodies, which we ought to keepe ſo carefully, to offer them a holy and an acceptable ſacrifice vnto God? or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his urercies ſo long, and with ſuch obſtinacie to trie his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which are things of ſuch value and price? or to crucifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Sonne of Chriſt Ieſus our onely Souiour, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine him as much, or more then the Iewes? or to giue an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto all the world, and to miniſter an occaſion to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to blaſpheme the name of our God, and to make the death and reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> of no account: the one of which ſhould mortifie the concupiſcences of our fleſh, and the other ſhould raiſe vs vp to a hewnes of life? or to denie the effect of out baptiſme, and to reuoke the promiſes which we haue made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by the mouth of our parents in the face of his Church? or to eate the fleſh, and drinke the blood of our Sauiour vn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, when we come to his ſupper? all which is done by them, who giue themſelues vnto all diſſolutenes and ſenſualitie of life. If then the wrath of God be ſo greatly prouoked,<note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto Princes, to reforme the miſchiefes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named.</note> and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that enſue thereof, ſo intollerable; thoſe who haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement in their hands, and who ought to haue nothing more deere vnto them, then the quiemes, reſt, health, yea and if it were, poſſible, the immortalitie of ſuch as are vnder them,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:130"/>can they doe better then to auoid, or elſe to correct the ſcandals and publike ryots, which offend all the creatures of the worlde, yea and often are odious vnto ſuch as commit them? It may be, the difficultie (as we haue ſaid before) is a meanes to withdraw them from ſo great an enterpriſe: for that the cauſe of ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue ſo long continued in the common-wealths, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are like vnto old ſoares, which are ſo feſtered and corrupted, that the ſurgeons are out of all hope to amend them. This cannot well be denied; and yet it is not ſufficient to ſay (according to the old prouerb) that it is not good medling with an old ſoare. For Princes who haue noble and generous minds, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what a glorie and honour it would be vnto them, to do ſuch a thing as ſeemeth impoſſible vnto others. Moreouer is it ſo ſmall a matter to reſtore ſo diſeaſed a bodie vnto health? ſo vnperfect and diſordered into a tolerable eſtate? I doubt not, if ſome one would begin to ſet his hand to ſo holy a worke, but the great and happie aduancement which God would giue in ſhort time, with the praiſes and commendations, which all honeſt men would yeeld thereto in all places of the world, would ſtirre them vp couragiouſly to proſecute the reſt, and that ſome Chriſtian emulation would mooue and provoke others to imitate their examples, in ſuch ſort, that we might be in ſome hope to ſee the golden worlde againe. And as I thinke, the meanes to attaine thereto, would not be very difficult: I will ſet downe ſome of the particular remedies, and leaue the reſt to the godly conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as be wiſer then my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt and the beſt meanes (in my opinion) is this,<note place="margin">The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> that ſuch Princes and Potentates as intend any ſuch reformation, ſhould firſt of all reforme them ſelues, and to the end, they ſhould keepe them ſelues, as farre as poſſible may be, from all euill, they muſt abſtaine from all ſhew thereof: conſidering that as they are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours to all other in dignitie and authoritie, ſo ſhould they be the leaders and guides in vertue and honeſtie. For otherwiſe they cannot correct offendours, no more then a crooked rule can make ſtraight ſuch things as are meaſured by it.<note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded of King <hi>Porus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he kept priſoner, how he would be uſed: Like a King, ſaith he: and asking him the ſecond time, if he would anything elſe? he anſwered, No; for in this all other
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:23951:130"/>things are compriſed: declaring thereby, that Princes ought to ſurpaſſe and excell their ſubiects in euery vertue, as farre as the Sunne ſurmounteth all the reſt of the ſtarres in light and in brightnes: and on the otherſide, that their authoritie and their greatnes ſhould be ſufficient, when ſo euer they conſider of it, to alienate and eſtrange their minds from vice. <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſonne to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> beeing deſired to goe to a banquet, where there were many light women; asked the opinion of <hi>Menedemus</hi> the Philoſopher, who was with him at that preſent, whether he ſhould goe, or not: who anſwered nothing elſe but this; that he ſhould remember he was a Kings ſonne: as though thereby he would aduertiſe him, that this was ſufficient to withdrawe him from doeing of euill, and from all occaſions that might mooue him thereto. Now if Princes would ſhew them ſelues vertuous and well ordered in ſuch places where they liue, and be vnto their people in ſteade of liuing lawes, there were no doubt but they ſhould be followed of moſt of their ſubiects. It is reported, that if in a heard of goates, there be any one that hath eaten of the hearb called <hi>Eringion,</hi> preſently ſhe ſlandeth ſtill and ſtaieth the whole heard with her, by a ſecret vertue that is in this hearb, vntill ſuch time as the heardman come and take it away out of her mouth. There is almoſt the like power in Princes, to ſpread either vice or vertue ouer all ſuch as come heere them, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent their Courts; and they lay hold of them, as the fire doth of ſuch matter as is next it, and oftentimes transformeth them into their owne natures, as the leaven doth the dowe, with which it is mingled. So that it is euident, that the beſt meanes for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to reforme theſe horrible and monſtrous voluptuous deſires, which at this day carie ſuch great ſway, is, (as I haue ſaid) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them ſelues and their Courts.</p>
               <p>The next remedie vnto this, is, to deuiſe ſome way,<note place="margin">The ſecond remedie is, to baniſh idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to acquaint their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and painefulneſſe</note> how their ſubiects may be emploied in ſome honeſt labour and exerciſe, and to ſet downe grievous and ſharpe puniſhments for ſuch as liue idely in their kingdomes and countries. For it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that nothing doth ſo ſoone ingender whoredome, as idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and men (as that old and auncient <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to ſay) in doing nothing, doe learne to doe euill. And therefore <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> was wont to ſay; that loue was the trade and occupation of
<pb facs="tcp:23951:131"/>loyterers, and <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith; that <hi>Egiſtus</hi> had not beene an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but that he was idle. Which thing the Scripture alſo repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of <hi>David,</hi> who hauing committed the managing of his affaires to <hi>Ioab,</hi> betoke him ſelfe to his reſt and quietnes: but he had not beene long at eaſe, but preſently he began (contrarie to the commaundement of God) to covet his neighbours wife: by occaſion whereof there enſued afterwards infinite miſchiefes in his owne houſe. The auncient painters did vſe to picture <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> ſitting vpon a ſnailes ſhell, not onely (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth interpret it) to giue vs to vnderſtand, that women (according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> rule) ſhould keepe at home, and not be gadding vp and downe the ſtreetes to ſhew them ſelues, and be pratling like buſie bodies: but alſo to ſhewe that there is none ſo much giuen to voluptuouſneſſe, as idle and ſluggiſh perſons. I would to God, that theſe our times did not prooue the trueth hereof ſufficiently: but I thinke euery man knoweth, how diſſolutely theſe men liue, who ſpende their daies in ſlouth and idleneſſe. For the greateſt nomber of them, doe nothing elſe but inuent and deuiſe newe pleaſures, to entiſe women and young maides to lewdneſſe, to buie and ſell them, as hackney-men doe their iades, and to exchange them, as olde veſſels for newe. Which doth euidently ſhewe, that there are no greater enemies to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie and continencie, which they aſſayle by all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſeeking to conquer them by force, or by great and rich giftes to attaine their abhominable purpoſes. And to this ende they are very liberall, nay prodigall, and care not what they ſpende, to ouerthrowe chaſtitie, which they deteſt exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is very neceſſarie then, that the Prince (to take away this miſchiefe, and to reduce his people to an honeſt and laudable forme of life,) ſhould compell his ſubiects to take labour and paines, euerie man according to his eſtate and calling.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very requiſite and neceſſarie,<note place="margin">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie is, to baniſh ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and ale-houſes.</note> that the lawes made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ale-hhuſes, ſhould be put in practiſe, and ſtraightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and that the Iudges and Magiſtrates in euerie Conntie, ſhould looke diligently vnto them. For if they be alwaies written in bookes, and neuer executed, they ſerue to no more purpoſe, then a ſworde that is alwales in the ſheath, and neuer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23951:131"/>handled. And for that they were not made but onely to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect publike and common drunkardes, it were nowe very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and needefull, that every maſter ſhould make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar lawe for his houſhold, and that all theſe exceſſiue expenſes, and ſuperfluous charges, which are accuſtomed to be made at great feaſtes, ſhould be reformed: otherwiſe theſe voluptuous ſinnes will neuer ceaſe. For as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith, <hi>Venus</hi> alwaies keepeth companie with thoſe that are full, and not with the hungrie. And for this cauſe, in old time voluptuous men were likened vnto ſowes, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) are the moſt fruitfull beaſtes of all other, by reaſon of their gluttonie, whereto they are naturally giuen and addicted. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> had an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome, that when as any of them died, they would rippe his bellie, and take out his maw and his guttes, and reueale them openly, either by this meanes, as by a ſacrifice, to clenſe the deade bodie, or elſe to ſhewe by this ceremonie, that they would puniſh the author of thoſe miſchiefes, which he had committed in his life time. Which giueth vs to vnderſtand, that this hath beene the opinion at all times, that nothing hath ingendered more laſciviouſnes, then abundance of bread, drinke, and other daintie diſhes.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie alſo (the better to frame men to an honeſt and chaſte converſation) to baniſh and aboliſh al laſciuious poemes and wanton ſonges,<note place="margin">The fourth remedie is, to baniſh all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements to lewdneſſe.</note> pictures, painting of faces, mummeries, maskes, periwickes, giltings, pearles, and in a worde, all the exceeding and curious ſumptuouſnes in apparell, and mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for that all theſe are nothing elſe (as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> ſaith) but as torches, to lighten and ſtirre vp our concupiſcences;<note place="margin">The fifth and the principall remedie is, to prouide prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout all the kingdoms and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to teache and inſtruct the people in the waies of God.</note> and meanes to effeminate and mollefie our mindes, and by conſequent to weaken the ioynts and ſinewes of vertue. All which things <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> did expreſſely forbid by his lawes (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his life.) By meanes whereof, the common-wealth of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was the beſt gouerned, for the ſpace of ſixe or ſeuen hundred yeeres, and had the greateſt nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honeſt and vertuous men, of any place of all <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is nothing more effectuall to purge and clenſe the worlde of this filthineſſe, then the pure and ſincere
<pb facs="tcp:23951:132"/>preaching of the worde of God. For there is nothing (as <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith) that doth ſo mortifie all our wicked and carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as the worde of God, when as the operation and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his holy ſpirit, is ioyned therewith. And therefore it is compared vnto a fire, which trieth and purifieth gold and ſiluer from the droſſe; and to a fanne that purgeth the good grayn from the chaffe; and to ſalt which ſeaſoneth our meates, and keepeth them from putrifying. And therefore the ſhorteſt way, that can be taken (in my opinion) to eſtabliſh a godly reformation, and to renewe (as it were) the face of this disfigured worlde, is to chooſe a ſufficient nomber of faithfull, wiſe, zealous, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced men, who ſhould haue authoritie continually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Lawe and the threatnings thereof, for the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vice, and eſpecially of that which is ſo manifeſt and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at this day. Beholde now ſome of the remedies which wee muſtvſe, for the rooting out of the vices and corrupt diſeaſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth,<note place="margin">Of vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pleaſures and ſuch as are vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> that according vnto our former diuiſion, we ſhould briefly declare the other kinds of pleaſures, which we call vnneceſſarie and ſuperfluous: and thoſe are innumerable. For ſome delight wholly in hunting, and ſpend all their revenue vpon their dogges, as <hi>Actaeon</hi> did. Others doe nothing but play at tennys, at dice, or vpon ſome muſicall inſtruments: others are wholly giuen to dauncing: and others take all their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their buildings, as <hi>Lucullus:</hi> others ſpend whole daies in catching of flies, and ſuch a one was <hi>Domitian.</hi> And an infinite ſort trifle out their daies, with doeing of nothing. And to bee ſhort, it were an infinite labour to rehearſe euery particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that according vnto the diverſitie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s humours, they finde out different paſtimes and delights. Now in a word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make an end of al this diſcourſe, we muſt diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe foure things.<note place="margin">Foure reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt the pleaſures afore named.</note> The firſt is that (according to the old prouerb) we ſeeke to auoid the exceſſe in euerie thing. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that (as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaide) ſuch as follow thoſe ridiculous and fooliſh paſtimes, are very vnfit to be emploied in matters of any conſequence. The third thing is, that ſeeing (according to the ſaying of <hi>Exnophon)</hi> there is nothing ſo precious, as time, nor which is more impoſſible to be recovered, when it is euill ſpent:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23951:132"/>therefore we ſhould be moſt ſparing hereof, and ſpend it with as great diſcretion as may be. The laſt thing is, that as wee ſhall giue an account of euery wicked and idle worde we ſpeak, ſo likewiſe ſhall we be accountant for all thoſe workes we doe, which ſerue not to any edification: and likewiſe of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which God hath beſtowed vpon vs, as our wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, our ſtrength and nimbleneſſe of body, our leyſure, and of whatſoeuer elſe we haue, if it be not employed as hee hath commanded. For ſeeing they are his goods, and that hee is the maſter of them, and that we are but his ſtewards, is it not reaſon they ſhoulde bee vſed according as he hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</p>
               <p>Wee muſt then (whenſoeuer wee apply our ſelues to any thing) firſt looke whether it tendeth to the glorie of God;<note place="margin">In concluſion hee ſheweth how we ought to employ our ſelues in the offaires of this liſe, and how we ought to vſe thoſe goods which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs in keeping.</note> Next vnto this, whether our neighbour ſhall reape any fruite and commoditie thereby, and be inſtructed to walke in his feare by our example: and finally whether that which we doe, appertaine and belong vnto our vocation or not: and then, after humble and heartie prayer vnto God, who hath made heauen and earth, we may boldly vnder his fauour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction enterpriſe whatſoeuer wee take in hand, and aſſure our ſelues, that he will bleſſe our indeauours, being vndertaken by the warrantiſe and direction of his worde. But if we be not onely content to hide that tallent in the ground, which God hath giuen vs, but alſo willing either vtterly to loſe it, or elſe to ſpend and conſume it fooliſhly and naughtily: ſhall we looke for any reward for ſuch vngodly and ſinnefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, ſeeing that our very negligence is ſo ſeuerely and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly puniſhed? It may be we thinke, as ſome young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe, who for that they are diſcended of ſome noble houſe neuer care for any good husbandry, but ſpend luſtily, for that their fathers are rich, and therefore they are perſwaded they ſhal neuer want. In like manner, whenſoeuer we conſider, that we are the children of God, and that we are perſwaded, that the treaſures and riches of his bountie can neuer bee conſumed, then wee beginne to be prodigall of his goods, and ſpend thoſe graces riotouſly which it hath pleaſed him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon vs. But indeede wee ought to thinke withall
<pb facs="tcp:23951:133"/>that we are not his naturall ſonnes and inheritours, but his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by grace and adoption: and that if the father may iuſtly diſinherite his naturall ſonne, for his diſobedience, rebellion, whoredome, lewd parts, and wicked conuerſation: with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon may God diſinherit thoſe, who are his ſonnes onely by grace and mercy, if he once perceiue they commit the like ſinnes. And there is no doubt, but he wil quite diſinherit vs in the end, and take away all his graces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as he hath done fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whom he had choſen and loued as his eldeſt ſonnes, if we be vnthankfull, and if that in ſtead of ſeruing him and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thoſe bleſſings he hath beſtowed vpon vs, wee wholly employ them, to the ſatisfying of our owne wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and carnall concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. It behooueth euery man then to conſider diligently with himſelfe, how he may moſt profitably vſe thoſe bleſſings, which God hath beſtowed vpon him: which ſurely ought to be referred wholly vnto the honour and glory of him that gaue them, as to their principall and chiefeſt end: and next vnto that, to the helpe and comfort of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom we ought to cheriſh and relieue, whenſoeuer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered. Which if we performe, wee ſhall neuerſpend our time in fruitles and ſuperfluous things. And thus much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to haue ſpoken of theſe three ſortes of pleaſures, and for the fift paſſion of the minde, whereof we purpoſed to ſpeake in the beginning.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported that the Philoſopher <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide,</hi> beeing required of a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fellowe to speake his opinion of many things touching the goddes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee knewe nothing of all that was demanded, but onely this, that the goddes hated and abhorred ſuch as were curious and buſie medlers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee evidently declared, that curioſitie is a daungerous diſeaſe, and a ſore that muſt be healed, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue quietly and inpeace. To effect and accompliſh this peaceable eſtate and condition of life, this preſent booke may ſerue in stead of many others: beeing very excellently and ſubstantially penned, and furniſhed with all ſuch ſound reaſons, as either the auncient or moderne writers haue alledged againſt this paſſion. After that he hath declared what this curioſitie is, he ſheweth that there are three chiefe heads or fountaines from whence it sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. The first is, the care that euery one ought to haue in his vocation, which is commendable and often commended vnto vs: as contrariwiſe, careleſneſſe is condemned by ſixe ſeverall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are garniſhed with ſundry ſimilitudes, notable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and worthy examples: and then he ſheweth how euery one ought to vſe himſelfe in his vocation. The ſecond is, our great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding care concerning the euents of our counſels and ontorpriſes: againſt the which, as proceeding ordinarily of diſtruſt and vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, hee oppoſeth the conſideration of the prouidence of God, whereupon he exhorteth euery one to reſt, and stay himſelfe. The
<pb facs="tcp:23951:134"/>third is, the carefullneſſe wee haue to prouide vnneceſſarie and hurifull things, and this is properly thit curioſitie, which is a ſworne enemie to the quiet reſt and tranquilitte of our mindes. The miſchiefes whereof, hee ſetteth downe in particular, and addreſſeth himſelfe in eſpeciall to our nation,<note place="margin">The French nation very curious.</note> which is infected and ſtayned with this vice: ſetting downe ſundry notable examples, both ſacred and prophane, ancient and moderne, which doe euidently prooue, what miſchiefes this curſed humour hath hatched and brought foorth, both in Church and common wealth: and vnto thoſe, annexeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, by which it appeareth, how vnſeemely a thing it is for a man, be he neuer ſo mightie, to intermeddle him ſelfe in other mens matters, adding hereto apleaſant diſcourſe, and ſundry emblemes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie delightfull, with very fit compariſons to this purpoſe. And for the more full and ample manifeſtation hereof, hee produceth ſundry other hiſtories of ſuch troubles and tumults, as many light headed fellowes haue ſtirred vp in diuers cuntries and commonwealths. Next vnto this, hee diſcouereth the cauſes of this wicked curiouſnes: the firſt wherof, is the lightnes of our wits: the ſecond is, our ſlouthfulnes: the third is, the diſdaine and contempt of that eſtate, whereto we are called: the fourth is, our ambitious deſire to ſurpaſſe others. Againſt euery one of theſe diſeaſes, he oppoſeth ſeuerallremedies. In the latter end of this booke, he diſputeth against that profane curioſitie of diuers men, who are deſirous to knowe hidden and ſecret things, and ſuch as are vnlawfull &amp; dangerous, both in respect of God, of nature, and of our neighbours: ſetting downe contrary reaſons: and then nameth the whole rable of curious perſons. In the firſt ranke are <hi>Alcumiſts</hi> &amp; ſearchers for gold, ſuch as meaſure the whole world, and neuer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues: The Iudiciall <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> who gaſing continuallie vpon the circles of the heauens and motions of the starres, doe neuer looke what is done in their owne houſes. In the ſecond ranke are placed petifoggers in the law, and vnlearned phiſitians, who forſaking the reading of good books, do buſie themſelues in nothing but in ſetting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither by the eares, &amp; putting to ſale counterfait drugs, whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth the deſtruction both of body &amp; goods. In the last rank he placeth Sophiſters, Southſayers, Cabaliſts, spirituall Libertines, and profane Atheiſts. Againſt whoſe deteſtable vanities, he oppoſeth that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall doctrine &amp; inſtruction, which all men ought to learne, anſwering in few words ſo much to their curioſity as is requiſite for the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:23951:134"/>of Chriſtians. Finally, he anſwereth vnto the vaine curioſitie of ſuch as are buſie to know the ſecrets of their neighbours, and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth their filthie and wicked practiſes, very excellently: and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that curioſitie is a paſſion, not fit to be in any vertuous and good man: concluding his diſcourſe with a notable exhortation, that we ſhould not deſire to knowe more of God, of nature, or of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, then may ſerue for our edification and instruction.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23951:135"/>by his wares, to be iuſt in his dealings, and to buy and ſell his marchandiſe, without deceit or couetouſnes: for a maſter of a family to prouide for his wife, his children and ſeruants, and to teach and inſtruct them in euery good worke: for a ſeruant to obey his maſter, &amp; to deale truly in whatſoeuer he is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for a ſchoolemaſter to inſtruct his ſchollers, as well in good learning, as in the feare &amp; obedience due vnto God: for a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard to watch ouer his flocke, and carefully to inſtruct them in the worde of God, and to edifie them by all meanes poſſible that he may: for artificers and labourers to gaine their liuings by the ſweat of their browes: for a woman to be a good huſwife and to diſpend thoſe things thriſtily, that are brought into the houſe by her husband. For he which doth not labour, ought not to eate, (as the wiſe man ſaith) and he that putteth his hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſome, is likely to fall into pouertie: ſeeing (as the olde ſaying is) God ſelleth his goods vnto ſuch men as are painefull and laborious. Which was ſpoken, not for that they doe deny,<note place="margin">Why care &amp; diligence is ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs in our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</note> that whatſoeuer we receiue from aboue, is freely and of Gods meere goodnes giuen vnto vs, without any merit of ours: or for that we can deſerue any thing, by our worthines and deferts: (for we are ſo far from meriting of any of theſe great and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable bleſſings and benefits, that it hath pleaſed God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs, that beſides, that we make our ſelues vnworthy by our vngratefulneſſe, we alſo continually deſerue to be wholly baniſhed, and thruſt out from the preſence of our God:) but by the ſaying afore rehearſed, the wiſe men of former ages would giue vs to vnderſtand, that God doeth not promiſe, neither yet will communicate any of his bleſſings vnto men, but with this condition, that they ſhould take paines for them: to the end, that thereby they ſhould acknowledge his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their owne vnworthines: and alſo that they may learne by this meanes, the better to eſteeme and account of them. Which they would not doe, if they were thruſt into their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, without any labour, ſo as they might enioy them at their willes and pleaſures. And this was the reaſon, why the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to ſay, that wee muſt pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fortune with our handes lift vp: giuing vs thereby to vnderſtande, that wee call vpon God in vaine to helpe
<pb facs="tcp:23951:136"/>vs in our neede, if wee will not take paines to helpe our ſelues. For if ſo be that be true, that God will neuer here thoſe prayers, which proceede not of faith, and that all faith is founded and built vpon his promiſes, wee neede not looke for any ayde from him, if we be not painfull: ſeeing he promiſeth vs nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be watchfull and induſtrious.</p>

                  <hi>Democritus</hi> being asked,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene the ſluggiſh and the painefull man, and of the bleſſing of God vpon the one, &amp; his curſe vpon the other.</note> wherein idle men differed from thoſe, that were painefull and laborious, anſwered, in that, wherein good and honeſt men, differ from naughty and wicked perſons. That is to ſay, in hope: For he which ſerueth God, and walketh in his waies, and will be painfull, hee need neuer doubt but he ſhall haue alway ſufficient to maintaine himſelfe well and honeſtly. But thoſe, who will be careleſſe, and exempt them ſelues from that common vocation whereto all are called, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euery one in generall (euen from the beginning of the world) haue beene enioyned to take paines, may aſſure themſelues, that God will curſe both them and their riches, ſo that in the end all will come to nothing, as we haue dayly experience of many ſlow backes, whoſe reuenues, though they be very great, are conſumed, and in ſhort time (like vnto ſmoke) are vaniſhed quite away. And there can be no other reaſon giuen thereof, but onely, that God doth not bleſſe them. For we ſee many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proſper, and maintaine themſelues very honourably, with halfe, yea with leſſe then the ſixt part of the others wealth: and yet keepe great houſes, are very liberall to the poore, they build and gather riches, and (that which is a ſpeciall thing) they pay euery man ſo well with whome they deale, that in ſtead of euill words, and bad reports, which the other haue in euery place and at euery mans hand, all men do commend and ſpeake well of them.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie then (if we will retaine the fauour of God) that we be painfull and diligent,<note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take paines in his calling.</note> as he hath commanded vs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the occaſions that are miniſtred vnto vs, and that like good children we imitate his example. For if (as <hi>S.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23951:136"/>that we are baſtards, and that we haue not onely degenerated from him that was our father, but alſo from the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all other creatures?

It is conuenient then, that we ſhould not be more ſhameleſſe, then this poore Cynick was: but that ſeeing (as we haue ſaide) that all the world mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth (as it were) dayly to labour, we ſhould likewiſe be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and not lie downe in the ſhade, for feare of burning our beauties with the heate of the ſunne: or in winter to ſit by the fire ſide, doubting leaſt if wee goe abroad, we were like ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to blow our nayles.</p>

For vvho is there
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23951:138"/>of any ſound iudgement, which will ſay, that the cunning, and craft which is vſed ſecretly and craftily to robbe other men priuily, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to doe, or to cogge a dye, or to keepe treaſon ſecret, or to play the pyrate and robbe at ſea, as did <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> and <hi>Dragule Raiz,</hi> or to entice youth to lewdneſſe, as Ruffians and bawdes doer or to coſen, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courtiſans doe: who is there, I ſay, that will affirme, that theſe craftie dealings and couſenages ſhould be termedby the name of exerciſes, which are ſo much the more hurtfull and pernicious, by how much he is the craftier and cunninger that doeth vſe and practiſe them? The like may be ſaide of thoſe exerciſes, which (though they be not hurtfull to any man) are notwithſtanding vnprofitable and ſuperfluous. For what is it worth to daunce vpon a line, or to make daungerous or perillous leapes or iumpes, as diuers tumblers doe? or to throw millet ſeede through the eye of a needle ſixe foote off, as hee did which was brought before <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his Apoth.</note> or to make harmonie and muſicke of ſwine, as the <hi>Abbote</hi> did before <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth: or to counterfait the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale as hee did before <hi>Ageſilaus:</hi> or to ſtand long vpon one legge like a crane: or to graue a carte, a carter, and his horſe in ſo ſmall a roome, that a little flie may couer them with her winges? and a thouſand ſuch like toyes and vanities, whereto diuers light headed fellowes do apply themſelues, beeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereto by the applauſe and commendation of the greater nomber of men, and the admiration of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: whoſe folly appeareth farre more euidently in this, then otherwiſe it would, if they vſed and exerciſed any good profeſſion and laudable ſcience, which might bring any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or commoditie: with it. For to ſpeake truly, theſe mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is nothing elſe (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid) but an exceeding wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of the minde and body, with loſſe of labour and time.

By this reproofe, and the anſwere which was made, wee may eaſily gather, what is to be obſerued herein: that is to ſay that extremities in all things are to be auoided. It is a point of euill husbandrie to be ſo careleſſe, as to let our goods go to naught by our negligence. And it is much worſe, when as wee are ſo greedie and couetous, that our deſire draweth vs to death and deſtruction. We can not then take a better courſe, or gouerne our ſelues more wiſely, then if we returne to Gods firſt inſtitution, and follow that order, which God hath ſet downe: that is, to make our goods ſerue for our

Shal not our minds when as they are inuironed with theſe ſtrong &amp; violent paſſions (as with mighty and ſtrong wals) be wonderfully vnquiet? and there is no better preſeruatiue againſt this poiſon, then to think that we can not adde a cubite vnto our height or ſtature,<note place="margin">Iere. 10.23.</note> by taking thought: and that, as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> ſaieth, the vvay of man is not in him ſelfe, neither is it in man to walke and to direct his ſteppes.

               <p>Whereby it appeareth,<note place="margin">Teſtimonies of the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of god.</note> that there is nothing more profitable vnto men, then that all their affaires are vnder the government &amp; rule of God, and wholly ordered by his devine providence: for they are ſure that if they love him, and be of the number of his Elect, that all thinges ſhall fall out well with them:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.27.</note> and ſeeing that he hath not ſpared his onely Sonne, but hath given him for vs, he will alſo give all other things with him.<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we be ſo tormented and vexed with the care and cogitation of thinges to come? Why doe wee not truſt in the worde and promiſe of ſo good a Father?

                  <hi>David</hi> having conſidered this, and being aſſuredly perſwaded that God was his buckler and defence, his glorie, and the lifter vp of his head, addeth with great aſſuredneſſe and conſtancie, that he woulde lay him downe and reſt, and would not be afraide though tenne thouſand ſhould ſet them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

                  <hi>Phillippe</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprooved for that he ſlept too long in the morning, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the multitude of thoſe affayres which he had daily to diſpatch, anſwered, that hee might ſafely ſleepe, ſo long as his livetenaunt <hi>Antipater</hi> was awake. In like manner may wee reſt at our eaſe, ſo long as this great eye of the providence of God which ſeeth all thinges, is open and carefull to guide vs and our affayres, when ſo ever wee commit them into his handes.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23951:141"/>and certen, then any that is repoſed in his creatures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, euery one of vs muſt painefully and diligently labour in that vocation whereto wee are called, and we muſt recommende our labours vnto God, to give them what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe it pleaſeth him: never doubting but God will bleſſe them, though for the time the meanes bee ſecrete and vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto vs.</p>
               <p>It remaineth no we that we ſpeake of the laſt ſort of cares and vexations,<note n="3" place="margin">Of the third ſort of cares concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and hurtfull things.</note> which a great number of men take of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impertinent matters. A thing that wonderfully vexeth and tormenteth mens mindes at this day. For there are fewe men, which can containe them ſelves within the boundes of their vocations, and who have not a ſecrete itching hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which muſt be skratched continually: and as though they were bitten with fleas, they are ever ſtirring and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to knowe many thinges, which are neither profitable nor neceſſarie, but rather verie hurtfull divers wayes,<note place="margin">Hee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the word of God.</note> as wee ſhall ſee hereafter. Firſt of all, I ſay, it is a verie naughtie thing, and expreſſely forbidden by the worde of God, to leaue thoſe thinges that appertaine vnto our eſtate and vocation, and intermeddle our ſelves in other mens matters. For it is meete that every one (according to the ſaying of <hi>Saint Paul)</hi> ſhoulde endeavour to bee quiet, and to meddle with his owne buſineſſe.<note place="margin">By ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</note> And even as wee ſee in a mans bodie diſtinct members to haue their ſeverall offices, the one not meddling with the others office and duetie, ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours doe not envie the ſuperiours; or that thorowe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and diſſention one of them ſhoulde refuſe to pleaſure the other: ſo likewiſe in Common-wealthes, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Church, all Chriſtians ought ſo to live one with another, that though their places and charges bee diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>By the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Luke. 10.41, 42.</note> yet they ſhoulde alwayes remaine vnited in their mindes, and ſhoulde be like divers travellers, which by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie wayes goe to one and the ſelfe ſame place. As <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> paſſed by a certaine village neere vnto Ieruſalem, hee was deſired by <hi>Martha</hi> to come neere and lodge in her houſe: where when hee eſpyed her buſie about many thinges, and that her ſiſter <hi>Marie</hi> ſate downe at his feete, to
<pb facs="tcp:23951:142"/>heare and vnderſtande his wordes, ſaid vnto her, (anſwering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a complaint that ſhe made, for that her ſiſter left her to ſerve all alone) <hi>Martha</hi> thou art carefull, and art troubled about many things: but one thing is neceſſarie: <hi>Mary</hi> hath choſen the good part, which ſhall not be taken away from her. Wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved her of two thinges, which ought to be kept and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Firſt, for that ſhe preferred her worldly cares before the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word of God. Secondly, for that ſhe tooke ſo many things in hand at once.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake truely,<note place="margin">By the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our minds which is illuſtrated by a ſitte compariſon.</note> it is not poſſible for a man to doe many things well: or that his mind ſhould be ſuch, but that in deviſing of ſundrie things, he ſhall finde him ſelfe ſcarcely ſufficient to do any one of them as they ought to be done. For as we ſee in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rivers, that the force of the water is greatly diminiſhed, when as the currant there of is turned into ſeverall little ſtreams, &amp; that both the heate &amp; the light do loſe very much of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when as they are diſperſed abroad into large and open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So likewiſe it happeneth to our minds, when as they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto ſeueral ſtudies which ſomtimes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie one to the other, ſo that we thinking (through an ambitious deſire) to doe many thinges, in the ende effect and bring to paſſe nothing, as we ſhould do And therefore <hi>Aeſop,</hi> being diſpoſed to deride this fooliſh &amp; ambitious cutioſitie, at ſuch time as he ſhould be ſold among 2 or 3 other ſlaves, &amp; that all of them being asked by the marchant, which ſhould buy them, what they knew, had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they knew all things, ſaid (being asked what he knew) that he knewe nothing, ſeeing they knewe all. Whereupon the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant perceiving the ſubtiltie and fineſſe of his wit, thought him more worth then all the other: and imagined that he had good occaſion to mocke the others preſumptuous mindes, who did brag they knew al things whatſoever, ſeing it is a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to find any man perfect, and ſufficiently inſtructed in any one ſcience, though he hath diligently employed him ſelfe thereto al the dayes of his life: according to the example of wiſe and skilful husbandmen, who cut and prune the ſuperfluous branches from their vines, to the ende that the ſappe and blood ſhould not be diſperſed among vnneceſſary boughes, but be conveyed to the good braunches, thereby to make them the more fruitefull:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23951:142"/>So alſo muſt we gather, and muſter as it were together, all the vigour and ſtrength of our ſpirites to one ſole thing, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bee excellent and ſurpaſſing therein. And for this cauſe <hi>Ambition</hi> it ſelfe, which (for that wee woulde bee eſteemed and renowmed among men) doeth make vs enterpriſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo divers thinges, ſhoulde withdrawe vs and plucke vs backe from that courſe. For we never heard of any man that prooved excellent in any thing, if hee did not wholly addict and conſecrate him ſelfe thereto. And I thinke there is nothing that hath ſo much hindered our nation from attayning vnto that height of perfection and glorie in many artes, whereto ſundrie of the Grecians and Latines aſpired, as that vayne and fooliſh Curioſitie which wee have, to give and addict our ſelves vnto many things. For (God bee thanked) there are as many excellent wittes in <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The curious deſire of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to know a little in every thing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ignorant in all things.</note> as in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie whereſoever, and ſuch as have a great good will thereto, and very able bodyes to endure any travaile: but wee ſee fewe that have the conſtancie to perſiſt and goe forwarde in any one arte or ſtudie: and there are not many, who have ſo much diſcretion as to chooſe that which is moſt meete and agreeable for them. Wee have ſcarcely ſo ſoone taſted the rudiments of any one arte, but foorthwith wee thinke we may proceede maſters in the facultie, and ſuppoſe we are famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly acquainted with every precept. And this is the reaſon why wee runne from one thing to another, and in a very ſhort time we thinke we have attained to all perfection, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. Doctors in every profeſſion: and by this meanes there ariſe many confuſions in the Church and Commonwealth. For after that wee are once poſſeſſed with a perſwaſion of our capacitie and ſufficiencie, wee foorthwith waxe proude and preſumptuous, we will give place to no man, we growe verie opinionate and ſtrong headed, wee will ſtourly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our owne imaginations, we never regarde, vnleſſe it bee too late, the counſell and advice of other men: and if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it bee offered, we are aſhamed to followe it; we will needes be beleeved both in matters of warre and peace, both in pollicie and divinitie, and generally in whatſoever we ſay or doe, we will be Orators and Poets, Captaines, muſitians, and
<pb facs="tcp:23951:143"/>all in conceite: like the foole of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> who being over-ruled with a melancholicke humour, was perſwaded that he was the richeſt man that was in all the world, and that al the ſhips which arrived in the haven were loden with his marchandize. And we thinke that we are excellently ſeene in all thinges: ſo that in this point we diſter little or nothing; for we are wiſe as he was rich, that is, onely in conceite and opinion. And with this fooliſh cogitation we enterpriſe great matters, when as indeede we are as fitte to compaſſe them, (as the olde ſaying is) as an aſſe is to ſing, or an oxe to daunce.

               <p>Among other things that the falſe prophets are blamed for this was one of the principall; that they would prophecy and preach every where without any vocation. For it is impoſſible that we ſhould be fitte for any thing, if wee be not called thereto by the

And this is the reaſon, why (as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith in his firſt <hi>Satyre)</hi> that the marchant beeing vpon the ſea in ſtormes and tempeſts, and ſeeing in what daunger both hee and his goods are, beginneth to lament his owne misfortune, and to complaine of his eſtate and condicion, thinking that euery man is more happie then him ſelfe, and that his neighbour li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a farre merier life, then he doth. So likewiſe doth the lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, when as his clyents are knocking at his doore, and breakes him from his ſleepe too timely in the morning. As alſo the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who laboureth all day with little cheere, and abideth hunger and colde, with many other ſorrowes all his life long. God knowes euery one of theſe, is wondrous plentifull, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting his owne miſchiefes, &amp; the ſorowes whereto he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: as alſo in remembring his neighbours quiet life and great felicitie. But as in commending the one, they regard nothing but the eaſe and quietnes thereof: ſo in diſpraiſing the other, they reſpect nothing but the ſorow and vexation where with it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied. Whereby it euidently appeareth, that the greateſt cauſe of our inconſtancie and mutable curioſitie, is our idlenes, and hatred we beare to trauell and paines taking.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> one of the moſt famous Captaines that euer was in <hi>Greece,</hi> was once choſen by the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> to looke to the making cleane of the ſtreetes and clenſing of their ſinkes: and albeit in the opinion of diuers of his friends, it was a very diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable office for ſo worthie a perſonage: yet he accepted of it very willingly, ſaying, that he would make it apparant, that men were not honoured by their offices, but that the offices were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the men: and afterwards he ſo wiſely and diſcreete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaued him ſelfe in his charge, that he purchaſed great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and commendacion throughout the citie.

                  <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe, ſetteth downe a verie fitte compariſon of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a mans bodie, ſaying that thoſe members which ſeeme to be more feeble are neceſſarie, and vpon thoſe members of the body which we thinke moſt vnhoneſt, put we more honeſtie on: and our vncomely partes have more comlineſſe on.

And therefore it becommeth not vs to bee wearie of our vocations, and to deſire other callings we knowe not what.</p>
               <p>Ambition likewiſe is another great cauſe of this curioſitie wherof we ſpeake at this preſent.<note place="margin">Ambition, and an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mind to be above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the fourth cauſe of curioſitie.</note> For as we ſee covetous &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy minded men, which doe skratch &amp; ſcrape together they care not what, and without any ſhame doe plucke and wring from their neighbors they care not how, nor by what meanes. (as may well appeare by the impoſt and taxe which the Emperor <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> laid vpon vrines) So likewiſe there are ſome ſo proude and ambitious, that they would be accounted the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men whereſoever they become. If they ſee any man that is an excellent Muſitian, a good Tennis-player, a ſwift Runner, a cunning fencer, a learned poet, a skilful minſtrel, or a faire game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they aſſay preſently if they can counterfait him, to the ende they may be ſpoken of, and that they may be placed in the rank of good fellowes. Now if thoſe things we vſe, be naught; we can not imagine a greater diſpraiſe then to be comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for them: and if they be indifferent, all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation that we can reape by the knowledge of them, is like vnto that, which is often given vnto the prodigall man, that he maketh ſmall account of mony, and purchaſeth things of no value at a high rate. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo precious as time. If then we ſpend much thereof to learn ſome vnprofitable arte, wil not all wiſe men ſay, that we are evil husbands? and if they be good and commendable things, we muſt alſo conſider, that it is no more ſhame to beignorant of ſuch of them, as doe nothing appertaine vnto our vocation, then it is for the eye to be dumbe, or the tongue to be blinde; and in thoſe thinges which appertaine vnto our vocation and calling, wee muſt yeelde vnto God the whole praiſe and commendation. And therefore we may ſafely conclude, that <hi>Ambition</hi> muſt not make vs fall into this fooliſh and curious paſſion.</p>
               <p>Nowe the laſt and ſpeciall occaſion of this curious humour is,<note place="margin">Selfe-love the fiſt cauſe of curioſitie.</note> for that, by reaſon of our ſelf-love, we never ſufficiently know ourſelves, neither yet our owne imperfections. For if we would meaſure our ſtrength, and conſider the weakeneſſe of our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23951:149"/>mindes, and the ſhortneſſe of our lives, we would thinke it a verie difficult thing, perfectly to attayne any one arte, though all the dayes of our lives were imployed therein. For albeit that <hi>Tullie</hi> had beſtowed his whole time in <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> yet was not his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo excellent, but that there is ſomething wanting; and hee him ſelfe conceived a more ſurpaſſing Idea and forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then ever hee was able to expreſſe in any one of his Orations whatſoever. Who is there then, who ſeeing ſuch a man, who was endued with ſo divine vnderſtanding, and had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch wonderfull and exceeding travayle and paynes, and yet coulde not attayne vnto the perfection of one onely Arte, that dare hope to come to an abſolute knowledge in two orthree? <hi>Theophrastus</hi> complayneth that mans life in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is too ſhort to laye ſo much as the foundation of any of the liberall ſciences. And, to ſpeake truely, it is a very difficult thing, what paynes ſoever wee beſtowe, conſidering the weakeneſſe of our capacities, and the obſcuritie of thoſe thinges wherein wee beſtowe our indeavours: yea ſuch as for their rare knowledge in mechanicall artes, haue bene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted famous throughout all the worlde, beeing better able to judge of their practiſe, then the other of their ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, have not withſtanding accounted them ſelves verie ignorant and vnskilſul, when they haue done all they could.

Howe is it poſſible then, that we in ſo ſmall a time and with ſo meane wittes ſhoulde attaine many ſciences, if they, who have bene ſo ingenious and ſo painefull,<note place="margin">The better to beat downe this pride &amp; ſelfe-love, be ſheweth that God alone &amp; no other is able perfectly to accompliſh many things.</note> applying them ſelves onely and whollie to one particular Arte, coulde notwithſtanding never attain any entire &amp; abſolute perfection therein? It is a divine work, &amp; that which exceedeth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s capacity, to be skilfull in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things. Our mindes &amp; ſpirits which haue a heavenly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are diverſly occupied in the ſeverall parts of our bodies For they teach our eies to ſee, our eares to he are, our to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues to ſpeak, or feete to go; they vnderſtand, they learne, they diſcourſe, they
<pb facs="tcp:23951:150"/>remember, they reaſon and conclude all at once. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerour God, who is, as it were, the minde and ſpirite of all the worlde, doeth quicken, ſtrengthen, ſuſtaine, moove, and conducte every thing, doing all this in an inſtant. But this is miraculous, ſupernaturall, and an impoſſible thing for men to bring to paſſe by any travayle or diligence whatſoever. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> him ſelfe) by whome all the worlde is governed and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained) as he was mann, ever enterpriſed any more offices then one at once. For before that by his Baptiſme he was eſtabliſhed and confirmed in his miniſterie, hee was content to live like a Carpenter; and after hee was called, as it were, to preach, hee did not meddle with any other calling. When as they woulde haue made him a King and a Iudge, hee woulde in no wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof: not that he was not furniſhed with ſufficient giftes to diſcharge ſuch offices, and all other whatſoever, if it had pleaſed him, but becauſe he was not called to that end, and for that he would teach vs by his example, howe we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſelves within the limits and boundes of our vocation. There is nothing better then (to correct this curioſitie and nice humor,<note place="margin">A remedie againſt this evill.</note> which maketh vs enterpriſe ſo many vaine and frivolous matters) to knowe our owne weaknes and vnableneſſe, as alſo the dulneſſe of our vnderſtanding, and withall to conſider the ſhortnes of our lives and vnſtable eſtate, wherein we are placed.</p>
               <p>Having diſcourſed hitherto of that fooliſh curioſity and fond deſire,<note place="margin">In the lattrr end of this booke he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prophane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie of ſuch men as ſearch after ſecret &amp; bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thinges which are both vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (conſidering in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.10.</note> and therein purpoſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our follie) ſaide, (in reprooving <hi>Nicodemus</hi> one of the principall Doctors among the Iewes, for that he could not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his ſpeach, touching the regeneration of water, and of the ſpitite) Art thou a maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things? If I tell you earthly things, and you beleeue not, howe ſhould you beleeue, if I tell you of heauenly thinges? by earthly thinges he vnderſtandeth ſuch myſteries in the kingdome of heaven, as are moſt eaſie to bee vnderſtoode: and by heavenly thinges, thoſe myſteries which are moſt obſcure and difficult; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring thereby, that we can not attaine vnto the knowledge of the one, vnleſſe we be taught by the vnderſtanding of the other. And therefore it was, that a certaine poore olde man ſeeing <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Mileſius</hi> as he walked in the fieldes in the evening, gazing vp to the ſtarres, and ſo buzie in his ſpeculation that he fell into a ditch, ſaid in mocking, that it was a great madneſſe for men to looke ſo high, that they never ſee what is before them. Whcih may alſo be a verie profitable admonition for vs: ſeeing it is but too vſuall a cuſtome among men in theſe dayes, to contemne thoſe things that are neceſſarie, and ſuch as we may eaſily attain vnto, and to wearie our mindes about obſcure matters, wherein it is better to be vtterly ignorant then to vnderſtande or knowe them perfectly.</p>
               <p>Some there are that do nothing all the daies of their lives,<note place="margin">In the firſt rancke of this curious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters.</note> but ſearch after the philoſophers ſtone, and in the ende by a ſecrete skill in Arithmaticke, do multiplie all into nothing. Others will needes meaſure the whole world, and knowe both the length &amp; breadth thereof, as exactly as of an acre of lande. Others goe to ſchoole to learne to prognoſticate: others are wholly buſied in nativities, and will needes take vpon them to foretell great mens fortunes and deſtinies: others write whole bookes of Magicke and Nigromancie, others of Palmeſtrie and Phiſiognomie, and ſuch like: and in a worde, many take great pleaſure in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of dreames. And who is there that is able in few words to expreſſe the fooliſh curioſitie of ſundrie men, who are never contented, what experience ſoever they have as well of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of theſe ſtudies, as of the maſters and teachers? And this kinde of curioſitie hath not only bene apparant in that which
<pb facs="tcp:23951:151"/>every wiſe man hath alwayes accounted naught and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo in thoſe thinges, which all men of vnderſtanding doe acknowledge for the ſingular giftes of God, and whereof we neede not doubt, but the knowledge is exceeding profitable and commodious. For ſome there are which haue ſuch lame and ctooked wittes, that they never walke rightly in any ſtudie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>If they ſtudie the Lawe,<note place="margin">In the ſecond rancke are placed Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp; philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent authors do betake them ſelves to pettifog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and drug-ſelling, whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue loſſe of goods, and deſtruction of body.</note> they lay aſide morale philoſophie, and the excellent writings of the beſt Civilians, and betake them ſelves to <hi>I</hi> knowe not what Doctors, ſo vnfitte and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeake of lawe, ſo doubtfull in their anſweres, ſo long and tedious in their diſcourſes, that there is no man, be he never ſo patient, that is able to reade over their writings. Not long ſince in the dayes of our forefathers, <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> were thruſt out of the ſchooles, and men betooke them to <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to <hi>Tartaret,</hi> and ſuch like Dunſes, who haue loſt much time in writing their bookes, and (as one ſaith) in ſeeking a fame to be accounted ancient writers, and have quite ſpoyled ſuch as by their example haue bene drawen to followe them. In like manner, among Phiſitians there was no mention of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> but they were laide vp in ſtudies to be conſumed with wormes; and men gave them ſelves to the reading of <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenne, Averroes</hi> and other <hi>Arabians,</hi> who never vſe any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode in their writings, nor any plainneſſe to reſolve obſcure queſtions, neither any demonſtrations to confirme trueths, and to refute falſhood: but (God be thanked) few there are, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in theſe muddy waters at this day, but had rather drinke of the pureſt and cleareſt fountaines.</p>
               <p>There were nothing more excellent,<note place="margin">The third rancke is of Sophiſters, Cabaliſts, &amp; other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which mingle their ſottiſh dreames with knowen trueths.</note> or more ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh our felicitie, then the ſtudie of Divinitie, if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as it ſhould be. But there have alwayes bene ſome ſo opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionate and ſelſe willed, who partly thorow folly and a corrupt imitation of their elders, and partly thorow an ambitious contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, will needes (though never ſo frantickely) retaine their ſophiſtrie, compelling their ſchollers to ſweate, as they them ſelves have done, and to hunt after ſuch queſtions, as are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnprofitable, ſuperfluous, or inexplicable: whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they ſhoulde employ their youth, and flower of their

They demaund what God did before he made the world? howe the Father in one and the ſelfe ſame inſtant ingendred the Sonne: howe many orders and degrees there are among the Angels, what difference in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: who thoſe are that God hath written in or blotted out of his booke, and whome he will ſave, or condemne? what is the ſubſtance of the fire wherein the ſoules of the wicked ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If wee would deale thus with this curious humour and itching affection, reſeruing it to further vs in that which is neceſſarie and profitable for vs, it woulde ſurelie ſerue vs in greate ſteade, and there woulde bee nothing ſo harde and difficult, which wee might

And for that I firſt made it for mine owne particular vſe, and for the benefit of ſome others, who are well affectioned to the true ſeruice &amp; worſhip of God, I purpoſe to handle it farre differing from the manner of the Philoſophers writings, and heatheniſh diſcourſes: for they haue diſputed of nothing in their treatiſes, but of the feare, which we may haue of externall and accidentall chances: neuer mentioning thoſe dreadfull and horrible torments of the conſcience, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed and diſmayed with the conſideration of the wrath &amp; iudgements of God, for that it ſeeth it ſelfe clothed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grieuous and monſtrous ſinnes.

As touching the feare of the loſſe of our wealth and riches, we muſt firſt conſider the promiſes of God: that is to ſay, that in hearing his word, &amp; in obeying his will, our fields, our vineyards, our fruit, our trees, our garners, our ſtorehouſes,<note n="1" place="margin">The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God.</note> all our cattell and whatſoeuer we haue ſhalbe bleſſed: that he will giue vs ſufficient ſtore of foode in time of famine, that wee ſhalbe alwaies able to liue of that which we haue; and that in ſeeking his kingdome, &amp; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes thereof, all other things ſhalbe plentifully prouided. And in propounding thus vnto our ſelues his promiſes, we muſt alſo conſider (the better to aſſure vs) the immutable &amp; vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able verity of him that hath made them:<note n="2" place="margin">His immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth.</note> and withall the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull &amp; exceeding power of his word, not only in the creation of all things of nothing,<note n="3" place="margin">His power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> but alſo in the conſeruation &amp; maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them afterwards, &amp; we may ſee apparantly by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in the heauens and other elements, which euen from the firſt creation haue bene alwaies preſerued in their eſtate by the power and might of his deuine word, without any amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or reparations.

My friend, whoſoeuer thou art that maketh this anſwere, I would demand of thee, whether it be in regard of thy ſelfe, or of him, that thou art afraid to loſe him while he liueth, and lamenteſt ſo greatly when he is dead. If in this, thou reſpecteſt no man but thy ſelfe, that is to ſay, the pleaſure and delight thou didſt take in his company, and the profit thou didſt reape by him: I ſay, that thy feare and forow do not proceed of any loue thou didſt beare vnto him, but of the affection and loue towards thy ſelfe, which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23951:162"/>for the moſt part is naught and full of corruption, and eſpecially when it propoundeth vnto vs nothing but worldly promotions, tranſitory honours, &amp; temporall pleaſures &amp; delights, all which if we be dead vnto the world, we would neither deſire nor wiſh for for. We are perſwaded peraduenture, that if we ſhould not make ſuch ſhew of feare &amp; ſorow, it would be thought we did not loue our friends: and ſhal we not conſider on the other ſide, that ſome peraduenture will thinke we make but a counterfait ſhew,<note n="3" place="margin">It is better to follow our friendes then to be deſirous to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back to vs.</note> and that others will thinke it is but a carnall and worldly affection we beare towards our ſelues? wherein ſurely they are not greatly deceiued: for it is moſt certen, that if we loued our friendes as well as we loue our ſelues, we would rather deſire to follow them then to be deſirous to bring them backe vnto vs: and when as they are gone, to make all the haſt that may be to follow after. This exceeding feare we haue of the loſſe of our friends, is an euident ſigne not onely of the great affection we beare towards our ſelues, but alſo of the ſmall loue we beare towards God. For if we did loue him as we ought to doe,<note n="4" place="margin">The will of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whoſe pleaſure wee muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme our ſelues, ought to take away this griefe from vs. A very apt and fit ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, and with all our ſtrength. This loue would raze out the other, and make vs wholly forget it, and it would ſo rule all our affections, that we ſhould loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which liketh him. We ſee that the loue of the husband tovvardes his vvife, and of the wife towards her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band encreaſeth more and more, and that in ſuch ſort, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be once married, they forget all other things, and ſtudy by all meanes to augment their affection, and are content to leaue both father &amp; mother, to the end they may dwell the one with the other. And if peraduenture they fal into any aduerſity, the exceeding great affection they beare the one towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth make them to beare &amp; tollerate it moſt patiently: as <hi>Moſes</hi> reporteth in the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> vvho after that he once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to loue <hi>Rebecca,</hi> preſently began to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, &amp; to leaue ſorovving for his mother <hi>Sara.</hi> In a vvord, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth once perfectly loue her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, though ſhe ſee all her friends die before her face, yet ſhe vvil be ſoone reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is remaining &amp; in health.

In like maner do we ſhew our ſelues too hauty and high minded, when as being not content to liue in the company of God and his angels, we ſeeke to aſſociate our ſelues with baſe and beggarly companions. And ſuch are all our mortal &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friends, of whom we make ſuch great reckning &amp; account. With the conſideration whereof we may comfort our ſelues as did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſhould haue ſacrificed his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> according to the commandement of God.<note n="12" place="margin">God may reſtore our friends vnto vs againe, or elſe may giue vs newe which ſhalbe better then the old.</note> And we may be well quieted, conſidering he may raiſe and reſtore them againe, as well as he did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the widowes ſonne, &amp; the daughter of the ruler of the ſynagogue: or elſe giue vs newe, which ſhalbe as faithfull &amp; as affectionate as the old.

If it be ſo, and that by this meanes the one be delivered from labour, from ſickeneſſe, from povertie and olde age, and the other from a thouſand ſorrowes, griefes, cares, and vexations whereto it was ſubiect, to reſt in peace and quietneſſe for ever, and to enioy an everlaſting happineſſe and felicitie, why ſhould we be afrayde leaſt they ſhould dye? or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo greatly when as they are dead?</p>
               <p>Let vs ſuppoſe that our friendes were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome with <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We ought alſo to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie exchange that they make, which wilbe a great meanes to aſſwage our ſorrowes.</note> reioycing and making merrie in the middeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the godly olde Fathers: or in <hi>Salomons</hi> Courte hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his great and excellent wiſedome, beholding his glorie, and the magnificence of his houſe: or in that terreſtriall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and in full fruition of all the pleaſures and profites that were there; participating of the pleaſant fruites, ſweete ſavours, and beautifull walkes; receiving, as it were, the hommage and allegiance of the wilde beaſtes, who come in all humilitie to acknowledge them for their ſoveraigne lordes: or at the table of the King with their marriage garments, drinking of the cuppe of immortalitie, and hearing of the melodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Angels: or in the Temple of <hi>Sion</hi> glittering with gold

I would know if our friends were in ſuch eſtate and condition, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whether we ſhould haue any occaſion to lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their deathes? If then after their departure they be better then we can imagine, and yet we will needes be ſory for them, it can not be in regarde of any love we bare towardes them, or for any feare we haue, leaſt they ſhould not be at their reſt and quietneſſe.</p>
               <p>Who hath heard at any time, that thoſe who have dyed in the faith of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thoſe that dye well, and be once in heaven, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſire to returne to the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe.</note> ever complained, or were not content with their eſtate and condition? or were ſorie that they had left the pleaſures, riches, and friendes, which they had in this worlde? or that they preferred them before the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore ſought to returne againe into the earth? Wee have read of many, who are departed out of this worlde full of dayes (as the Scripture ſaith) and who, notwithſtanding the eaſe and pleaſure which they enioyed here, did neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fervently deſire to bee gone, and to bee delivered from hence: but on the contrarie, wee never heard of any that were deſirous to ſhunne the life to come: or that with any continuance of time coulde bee ſatisfied, or ever ſet his mind vpon any better thing, or deſired to chaunge his ioye and pleaſure? And there is one principal marke, whereby wee may knowe the difference which is in the pleaſures of either life:<note place="margin">For that there is no compariſon betweene terreſtriall and celeſtiall pleaſures.</note> and that is, that though in this life there bee an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſorte of pleaſures, yet there is none ſo agreeable to our humours, but that at length wee are wearie of them, and finde a kinde of bitterneſſe in them, which wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth our taſte: but in the other there is an everlaſting and continuall delight. Seeing then that wee can pleaſure
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23951:166"/>them with no better thing, nor wiſh for any ioy but ſuch as they have the full fruition of, after their deathes, I may well conclude, that it is a verie vaine thing for vs, either in reſpect of them, or in regarde of our ſelves to feare, leaſt they ſhould die: and that among all the external and outward accidents which may happen vnto a faithfull man, there is not one which ſhould feare or diſcourage him.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding here of,<note n="5" place="margin">remedie; againſt the feare of the travaile and labour of our bodies in our vocations &amp; callings.</note> it is requiſite that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in like maner of other feares &amp; terrors, which may happen vnto vs. That which we are moſt afraid of in our bodies, is either labor, deformitie, impriſonment, diſeaſes, old age, or death. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der labor I comprehend the travel, paines, and afflictions which men through zeale, or malice do either iuſtly or injuſtly procure vs. As touching travell, we ought neither to flie it, nor to feare it. For this is a thing ordeined of God, &amp; decreed by him,<note n="1" place="margin">It is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God.</note> that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhould participate thereof: and is no leſſe profitable for the health of our bodies and ſoules, then idleneſſe is hurtfull and incommodious both for the one and the other. Were not this a goodly feare, to be afraid to walke in the generall vocation of all creatures? and that which is more, to follow the example of our heavenly Father, and of his Sonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> our Saviour:<note n="2" place="margin">God &amp; all his creatures may ſerve vs for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple</note> both which have bene continually occupied even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vntill this day?

Contrariwiſe we doe not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre povertie, but only becauſe we are afraide, leaſt we ſhoulde be compelled thereby to travaile and take paines: though that for this cauſe it ſhoulde ſeeme the more tollerable. Thus wee may ſee how diſordered and vnruly our nature is in every thing. For if we did rightly conſider the matter, we ought not ſo greatly to feare beggerie as Idleneſſe, nor to affect riches more then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paines taking. I purpoſe not to ſpeake further hereof at this preſent: for that I have diſcourſed of it alreadie in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place.<note n="6" place="margin">Remedies againſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note>

               <p>As concerning afflictions, it is not poſſible to avoid them: and therefore we ought not to feare them more then we do the labor
<pb facs="tcp:23951:167"/>and travaile of the bodie:<note n="1" place="margin">They can not be avoy ded.</note> for it were a vaine thing to feare that which wee can not avoyde, and to ſtudie to eſchewe that way wherein we are compelled to walke.

Doe we thinke that the devill, betweene whome and the ſeede of the woman there ſhall be continuall hatred, may be reconciled and be in peace and amitie with vs? Shal we be perſwaded, that God will permit his Church to live as it liſteth,<note n="2" place="margin">They are neceſſarie.</note> and give libertie to his children to live at their pleaſure? or that he will at any time ceaſe his corrections, whereby he maketh vs to vnderſtand his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpleaſure againſt ſinne, and to feele our owne wantes and imperfections? what repentance, faith, and humilitie ſhoulde we have? what confeſſion of our ſinnes, or prayers for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would there be in the Church, if wee were not exerciſed with croſſes and afflictions?<note place="margin">Examples.</note> Would <hi>David, Manaſſes, Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and the people in the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ever have ſo earneſtly beſought the Lorde to turne vnto them, and in pitie and compaſſion to looke vpon them, if they had not bin compelled thereto, by the miſeries and calamities whereinto they were fallen by reaſon of their ſinnes? and what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our rebellious fleſh, if the concupiſcences thereof were not continually mortified with torments and vexations?

If we would further conſider, that afflictions are evident tokens of the favour of God towardes vs, that they are common to vs with all the true children of God, and that they are the meanes to bring vs to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the ende and vttermoſt boundes of our hope: we muſt then of neceſſitie inferre one of theſe two; that either in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving we ſhall not be afraide of afflictions; or if we doe feare them, it is by reaſon of our vnbeleefe and incredulitie. And who is there, that is not perſwaded that it proceedeth of this, (as one ſaith) that we are counterfaite gold, and therefore that we feare the touch ſtone: and that if we had builded vpon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is <hi>Christ,</hi> golde, ſilver, and precious ſtones, we ſhoulde never be afraide leaſt our workes ſhoulde be manifeſted in the day of the Lorde?<note n="7" place="margin">A good conſcience never fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> but being perſwaded in conſcience that wee builde with ſtrawe and ſtubble, we can not chooſe but be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wonderfully afrayde to come neere the fire, leaſt there ſhoulde be any tryall made of our workes, or that our fayth ſhoulde melt away in temptation as waxe againſt the Sunne, and thereby make it manifeſt, that it was a falſe and a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite beleefe. And therefore it is a verie cleare caſe, that all this
<pb facs="tcp:23951:168"/>great and exceeding feare, whether it be of any daunger like to fall vpon vs, or of any torment or vexation like to happen to vs, proceedeth of nothing, but of the ſting of a guiltie conſcience, and the weakeneſſe of a feeble faith.<note place="margin">Sundry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons ſitte for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> Doeth the houſe that is builded vpon a rocke, feare leaſt the raine or hayle ſhoulde fall vpon it, or that the windes ſhoulde blowe, or the waves beate againſt it?

We doe very willingly take that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,<note n="9" place="margin">They choke and ſtrangle our ſinnes.</note> which wee ſuppoſe will take away corporall diſeaſes from vs, though that the operation be very vncertaine, and that wee bee deceived oftentimes by reaſon it worketh ſo ſmall effect.

We oftentimes ſeeke for ſurgeons at home in their houſes to launch, ſeare, yea and to cut off the putrifyed members of our bodyes: we are content they ſhoulde binde and tye vs, to the ende they may dreſſe vs at their pleaſure: we ſuffer all things patiently, and beſides our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt thankes, wee are content to recompence them for their paines.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23951:168"/>then thoſe of the bodie? what ſhall wee anſwere hereto? If wee will ſpeake the trueth, wee muſt frankely and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the principall occaſion hereof is this, that on the one ſide we doe not fully knowe the frowardneſſe and rebellious nature of our fleſh,<note n="11" place="margin">They are doubted of, but of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants.</note> neither the neceſſitie we haue to mortifie and ſubdue it: and on the other ſide, that we put not ſuch affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and truſt in Gods promiſes, as we doe in other his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: neither doe we beleeve that the afflictions and adverſities which he ſendeth, are for to correct, admoniſh, and ſcourge vs: as well as his bleſſinges are to comforte, to ſtrengthen, and encourage vs. For if we were well perſwaded of this, that God, what countenance ſoever he ſheweth towardes vs, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alwayes beareth the like love and affection to his children, and that all his counſels and actions tende to our profite and commoditie, as well when he woundeth vs, as when he healeth vs, we would as willingly receive his blowes as his bleſſings: or at the leaſt this perſwaſion would halfe diminiſh the feare wee haue of his roddes and corrections:<note n="12" place="margin">He which abhorreth them ſhall periſh with the world.</note> or if we did knowe the value of the ioyes and pleaſures of this world, and on the contrarie the auſteritie and rigour of God towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we would ſeeke diligently to imbrace the one, and ſtudie carefully to avoid the other. But as we ſee by experience that it is a verie difficult thing among men, to knowe a true friend from a fayned flatterer: ſo likewiſe without the ſpirite of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that God by his eſpeciall grace and favour vouchſafe to open our eyes, it is impoſſible that ever we ſhould knowe the loyaltie and ſynceritie of his love, and that wee be not abuſed by the deceitfull ſhewe of the worlde, and being once ſeduced, that we deſire not rather to bee drawen by the ſmyling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and entiſing ſhewe thereof,<note n="13" place="margin">Thoſe which ſeeke to eſchewe them, thinke ſcorne to be the ſchollers of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſo they periſh in impietie &amp; ignorance</note> then to bee rebuked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for our affection and zeale towardes our God. We ſee that among ſchollers ſuch as are idle and dull of vnderſtanding, are continually afrayde leaſt their maſters ſhoulde heare them their leſſons, and thereby finde and trye out their ſluggiſhneſſe and doultiſh ignorance; whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, ſuch as are paynefull and ingenious, deſire nothing more, then to bee often examined: and there is neyther ſeare nor dread that will make them give over their bookes.
<pb facs="tcp:23951:169"/>In like manner, that which maketh vs feare the afflictions and croſſes of this worlde, which are the ſchooles and diſcipline of the Lorde, is, for that we are verie vnwilling to take any paines. For if we were deſirous to knowe howe greatly God deteſteth ſinne, what that repentance and confeſſion is, which we ought to make in the Church; and generally, what mortification the frailety of this life, and the vanitie of all thinges in this worlde are, and howe for this cauſe we ought to withdrawe our hearts from ſuch tranſitorie thinges, and apply our ſelves thorowly to the ſearching and finding out of that which is ſtable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; to turne wholly vnto God; to truſt in him; to offer our prayers vnto him, with many other principall poyntes of our religion, which will never be throughly imprinted in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, vntill by the motion of the holy Ghoſt they be often remembred in afflictions, we woulde not ſo abhorre and deteſt them as we doe: but by reaſon that we have guiltie conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are privie to our ſmall and weake faith, and for that we haue wickedly beſtowed our times heretofore, and minde not to amende hereafter, this maketh vs become trewantes and runners away from the ſchoole, and to come to our tryall as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as may be, fearing leaſt that ſhoulde be diſcovered, which we woulde gladly keepe ſecrete, and that our vizarde beeing once taken away, our hypocriſie ſhoulde be layde open to all the worlde: whereby it may eaſely be conjectured, whether it be the wiſedome or the follie of our heartes, which maketh vs ſo carefully to avoyde afflictions. If we were well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that which is alreadie ſpoken, as well of the aſſiſtance of our God to enable vs to beare all adverſities; as of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereby he hath bounde him ſelfe to deliver vs from all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and daungers whatſoever, this vaine and fooliſh feare would ſoone ceaſe and come to an ende. Whether then we conſider the neceſſitie of them, or the cauſe whereof they proceede, or the profite and commoditie which doeth enſue of them, or the end whereto they are referred, there is no reaſon why we ſhould abhorre them, or ſeeke any meanes to avoide and eſchew them. And thus much concerning the travaile of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe come to deformitie, which is eyther naturall or caſuall. If it bee naturall, wee can not poſſibly avoyde it,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23951:169"/>and then by conſequent we ought not to feare it, neither ſhould we be ſorie for it, if we would conſider theſe foure things. Firſt,<note n="1" place="margin">It lieth not in our power to amend it.</note> that it lieth not in our power to amend it. For who is there that being borne with one eie, crooked, lame, or ſtarke blinde, that is able to amend his imperfection? Secondly, that God hath the the ſame power and authoritie ouer vs, that the potter hath ouer the clay, to frame and faſhion vs, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, as ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto him, and yet there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why wee ſhould complaine or be grieued thereat:<note n="3" place="margin">Wee must be content with thoſe gracei it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to beſtowe vpon vs.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of the foote, which is not diſcontented though it be not framed in ſuch dignitie as the hand, the eie, and the other members: ſo likewiſe muſt wee be contented with ſuch graces and gifts, as it hath pleaſed God to impart vnto vs. Finally, we haue deſerued, by reaſon of our manifold ſinnes, to be as deformed in all parts of our bodies,<note n="4" place="margin">

Whoremaſters, blaſphemours, bawdes, jugglers, ruffians, and ſuch like raſcals, are the companie we ſeeke for. And who is able to repeate all the dangers, whereto this youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companie is ſubiect by their exceſſe, raſhneſſe, ſtrifes, and quarellings? their prodigall and exceſſive expenſes; their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie; the griefe and ſorro we they bring to their frien des; and the diſhonour and reproch, which by their abominable lives &amp; ſhamefull deathes, they leave vnto their poſteritie for ever? In a word, in terming of it fooliſh youth, we do ſufficiently declare in what eſtimation we have it. From youth we paſſe vnto mans eſtate, which is, as it were,<note place="margin">In mans eſtate.</note> overwhelmed with infinite ſorowes and a huge multitude of cares. If we be private men, we muſt haue a care of our houſhold &amp; familie; howe to maintaine our wiues, bring vp our children, to provide we may give them ſomething when they are in age, to increaſe our wealth, and to ſee good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in our houſes, to governe and rule our ſervants, and to keepe all thinges well that are vnder our charges: all which are no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling matters, but of verie great waight, and farre more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto ſuch as haue any publicke charges, as Kinges and their livetenants. For they muſt firſt have regard, that God bee rightly ſerved in their dominions and territories: next vnto this, that Iuſtice be indifferently adminiſtred vnto al men vnder their ſubiection: that their frontier townes be well guarded, and their ſouldiers well paid: that they maintaine amitie with their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates: that the good be ſupported, &amp; the wicked ſuppreſſed. Al which is ſufficient to trouble &amp; diſquiet one mans mind, &amp; to poſe the wiſeſt head that ever was. Theſe things being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered,<note n="4" place="margin">Olde age is better able to beare afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then the reſt of the ages of our lives.</note> we may well perceive that the other partes of our life are as fully fraught with miſerie as old age: which hath this advantage over them, that the calamities &amp; miſeries thereof are farre more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for that the vigor &amp; ſtrength of the mind being impaired &amp; weakened, they are nothing ſo ſenſible as the others. And withal, olde men by reaſon of their experience are more wiſe, more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and better exerciſed in theſe afflictions, and for that they ſee their ende approcheth, they are aſſured they can not be of any long continuance. We may not then alledge the miſeries
<pb facs="tcp:23951:177"/>of olde age, to proove that it is worſe then other ages. For in comparing them together, wee ſhall finde that they are farre worſe and more diſcommodious.<note place="margin">Though olde age be not ſo ſtrong, yet it is farre more provident then youth.</note> 
                  <hi>M. Cicero</hi> in his booke of olde age alleadgeth foure eſpeciall cauſes, why theſe graye hayres ſeeme ſo odious in the eyes of many men. The firſt is, for that wee are not ſo able to take paynes, and therefore we are conſtrained to give over all intermeddling with thinges, and to ſitte all day in a chayre in winter by the fire ſide, and in ſommer to goe no further then the porch, beeing wholly vnfitte for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny companie. Whereto wee may anſwere as <hi>Tullie</hi> did, that in reſpect of bodily labour, olde men (indeede) are nothing ſo fitte as young men are. For they have not the ſtrength and agillitie to ride a great horſe, nor to ryde poſte, nor to runne at tilte, and many ſuch like thinges, whereto young men are moſt apt and beſt able. But there are many other thinges without doubt of greater importance, which they can perfourme well ynough, if they woulde applie themſelves thereto. They knowe howe to governe the whole Common wealth by their wiſedome: and ſometime to ſaue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Kingdome where they live from deſtruction: as may appeare by the example of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Examples.

And not without good cauſe. For it is an eaſie matter to finde armes and handes to execute, then wiſe and provident heades to devife: and withall conſidering that the one is farre more neceſſarie then the other, for the preſervation of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">If age were not as a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for youth, great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes would ſoone be overthrowen.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that ſome men, as <hi>Lucullus, Silla, Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, haue in their olde age giuen ouer the world, as it were, and left all affaires, betaking them ſelues to a quiet and ſolitarie life, yet notwithſtanding this is no common thing, neither yet greatly materiall for the diſproofe of that, which hath beene ſaide, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> prooueth by many excellent and ſubſtantiall reaſons. For as wee doe greatly blame thoſe bees, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene alwaies painefull and laborious, doe at the laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:23951:178"/>drones and good for nothing: ſo likewiſe is it a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely thing, for ſuch as haue all their liues had the ordering of waightie matters, and beene continually conuerſant in great thinges, to giue ouer all in their age, and dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their delights; for that then they are moſt apt for nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and meeteſt to meddle in matters of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by reaſon of their experience, wherin they farre ſurmount thoſe of younger yeeres: hauing their affections better ſtaied, and beeing freed from all paſſions which doe ſo often trouble vs in all our counſels and conſultations. If then, they will needes be idle at ſuch time, as their labour may be moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are worthie to be blamed, though the fault ought to be imputed to the perſon and to his pleaſures, and not vnto his age and yeeres.<note n="6" place="margin">As vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous old age is moſt to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of other: ſo on the contrary, vicious men deſerue moſt blame of all other.</note> The ſeconde reaſon which maketh vs afraide of olde age, is, the ſmall account that is made ordinarily of ſuch men as are in great yeeres. For by reaſon the younger ſort are perſwaded that they are frowarde, waywarde, pecuiſh, and harde to be pleaſed, therefore doe they auoide their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, as much as may be. And ſuch is the corruption of theſe daies, eſpecially of youth, who hate and contemne no man more, then thoſe at whoſe handes they may beſt learne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderſtanding. If then there be any thing in olde age, which deſerueth reproofe; it muſt partly be imputed to the malice of the time, wherin all things being turned topſe-turvie, that is moſt eſteemed, which ſhould be moſt deſpiſed: and on the contrarie, that moſt debaſed, which ſhould be moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and partly to the euill and naughtie life of ſuch, as are olde men, who (contrarie to the counſell of <hi>Cato)</hi> doe adde many groſſe vices vnto their naturall imperfections. For moſt of them are couetous, ſome voluptuous and giuen to pleaſure: others are iealous, envious, pratlers, drunkards, very idiots and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures. Now if at ſuch time as they ſhould be moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and temperate of all others, they become more profane and looſe of life, no marueile though they become odious &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.

<pb facs="tcp:23951:179"/>then, if we will be honoured in old age, that we be vertuouſly diſpoſed, auoyding the companie of the wicked, whoſe ſocietie tendeth exceedingly to our ſhame: and imbracing the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the good,<note place="margin">Famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch old age, as hath beene exceedingly honoured in the Church of God.

But

Xenophon</hi> reporteth of King <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> in this manner: His olde age farre ſurmounteth the youth of all other men of his time, and that euen in the extremitie thereof, when as he was readie to giue vp the ghoſt. What young man was there at any time in his moſt flouriſhing eſtate, ſo redoubted of his enemies, as was <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> in his old daies? what youth was there ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and ſorrowed for, as was this olde King and worthie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his countrey? what Captaine or Generall euer gaue a greater teſtimonie of his courage and valour, or more hope of aſſured victorie to his ſouldiers, yea, and that when as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt worne away with many yeeres? Whereby it doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare, that thoſe accidents before remembred, are not alwaies inſeperable companions of olde age, and that men, who haue liued ſoberly in their youth, ſhall be ſtrong and healthſome in their aged daies. Furthermore, wee may likewiſe ſay that which hath beene ſpoken before,<note place="margin">Old age hath fewerdiſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities then the other ages</note> that euery age hath his ſeueral diſcommodities: and if wee would take the paines to compare them together, we ſhal plainly perceiue more inconveniences in the former, then in the latter. And to conclude, that though the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23951:180"/>comelines, ſtrength, and force of the bodie doth decaie, yet the beautie and vigour of the minde increaſeth and flouriſheth more and more. Nowe if one would compare the prouident and wiſe minde of a graue and aged father, whoſe actions are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered with diſcretion, and ſeaſoned, as it were, with the ſalt of vnderſtanding, with the comely ſhape and portraiture of ſome goodly youth, whoſe heade is as full of toyes, as his tongue full of wordes, whoſe thoughts are very greene, and his actions groſſe; I would gladly know, which of the two ſhould be by reaſon, of greateſt eſtimation and account? There is a pretie fable of the foxe and the leopard, who contending about their owne excellencies, the leopard, to prooue him ſelfe the better, ſhewed his skinne, which was ſo trimly ſpotted, ſo ſlieke and ſo ſmooth, that there could not be a more beautifull thing among beaſtes: the foxe confeſſed in deede, that his skinne was very glorious and goodly without, but (ſaith he) my owne skinne is farre more excellent and precious within: couertly vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby, the wiſe and wily ſleights of his craftie heade. In like manner if in beholding the external beautie of luſtie youth, we would on the contrarie oppoſe the internall graces of aged minds, we ſhould ſoone perceiue which of the two is moſt loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and amiable. We may then ſafely conclude againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, that old age beeing garniſhed and adorned with wiſedome, grauitie, modeſtie, temperance, and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues, can not in any wiſe be contemned or deſpiſed,<note place="margin">

               <p>The thirde reaſon that maketh vs ſo exceedingly to feare, is, for that it depriueth vs of our pleaſures, and debarreth vs from our wonted ſportes and delightes. This is
<pb facs="tcp:23951:181"/>no fault of old age, but the blame reſteth in ourſelues, and doth iuſtly procure our owne condemnation. For we doe ſufficiently declare hereby, how fleſhly and carnall minded we are, deſiring not onely to liue, but alſo to waxe olde, to die, yea, and to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in our pleaſures.<note place="margin">To whome carnall men may fitly be compared.</note> And herein wee reſemble the Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Abbots, who hauing found the reuenewes of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix to be ſo great, and the bread of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> (as one ſaith) ſo toothſome, that they will in no wiſe, giue ouer their benefices ſo long as they liue, nor forſake their croſſes and mytres, vntill they be both beaten out of their handes, and ſtricken off their heads. In like manner, we finde the taſt and ſauour of theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo fitte and agreeable to our humours, that we deſire to be entombed in them, and are flat of opinion with <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that there is not a more beautifull buriall, or more glorious monument, then the lappe of this foule and deformed ſtrumpet. Who will not iudge then, that we are married together, and that we entirely loue each other, ſeeing there can be no ſeperation betweene vs, but by death? and who will not eaſily be induced to thinke, that we beare ſmall affection to vertue, conſidering we are in ſuch loue with her mortall enemie: and the wonderfull feare we are in, leaſt wee ſhould waxe old, and be compelled at the length to become honeſt men? Good Lord, when ſhall we ariue at the hauen of that perfection, which thou requireſt in thy law, ſeeing we are ſo ſlowe to hoiſt vp our ſailes and ſtand to our tacklings, ſcarcely ſetting foote into the ſhip, at ſuch time, as it were more meete, we were ariued in our wiſhed port? ſo much vnneceſſarie buſines haue we, ſpending our time in ſleeping and ſnorting, all the whole day together. But I would gladly know, what houres wee would ſpare for the ſeruice of our God, and to become vertuous, ſeeing we are loth to conſecrate our old age thereto.<note place="margin">

And doe we not herein verefie the ſaying of <hi>Horace,</hi> that wiſedome though ſhee be praiſed and commended of euery man, yet is ſhee glad to blow her nayles, for that no man wil take ſo much pity of her, as to let her come in and warm her by the fire ſide. It is commonly
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23951:181"/>ſaid, that there are no pleaſant and delightſome priſons, which we finde to be true by dayly experience. For though a man were impriſoned in the goodlieſt pallace of the world, yet would he quickly be wearie of his lodging; and yet notwithſtanding we find the priſon (wherein pleaſure keepeth vs ſo ſtreightly enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, though it be the moſt filthy and ſtinking dungeon that can be imagined) to be ſo pleaſant in our eyes, that we will in no wiſe come out of it all the dayes of our liues: there we wil needs die and be buried, abandoning the ſtately pallaces of vertue and godlineſſe, where wee might liue in ſo great eaſe, liberty and tranquility. I would proſecute this matter more at large, were it not that I haue diſcourſed of it alreadie in an other place, and plainly proued by ſundry reaſons how dangerous a thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is both to old and young, and therefore how carefull euery one ſhould be to auoid it: not onely old men, but likewiſe all others, of what age, quality, and condition ſoeuer. For which cauſe, it is not amiſſe to trauell in the plaine way of our vertuous elders, and to lay hold, as it were, with both the hands on many yeres, or any other occaſion whatſoeuer, which may diuert and turne vs from the pathes of vngodlineſſe. The fourth reaſon, which breedeth in vs ſuch a horrible dread and terrour of mind,<note n="8" place="margin">The laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the feare of old age, isto conſider that it bringeth vs vnto death, which is a paſſage vnto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</note> is this, that it is very nere vnto death.

For if, after a long and tedious iourney wherein we haue eſcaped infinite dangers, and endured all the iniuries and checkes, which either the time, place, or perſons could any way offer vs, in approching our houſes, where we hope to reſt and repoſe our ſelues, we preſently by reaſon of our exceeding ioy forget all our forepaſſed dangers: what thankes ſhall we giue vnto old age, which like a proſperous wind doth blowe vs ſo directly to the hauen of deſired happines, where God hath prouided for vs, moſt incomparable ioyes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for euer and euer?

                  <note place="margin">1. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 14.13.</note> when as <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his ſword-bearer ſet vpon them in their Campe. As alſo that of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in the time of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and in the reigne of king <hi>Ioram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. King. 7.6.</note> who being ſtroken with ſudden feare, ran away, leauing behind them their horſes, their charets, their tents, &amp; whatſoeuer they had in their campe. And the <hi>Burgonians</hi> in the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth,<note place="margin">Philip Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins in his 1. book. c. 19</note> being ſent to diſcouer the kings troupes lying harde by <hi>Paris,</hi> returned very ſpeedily, ſuppoſing the high thiſtles which they ſaw, to be men at armes. The feare which we haue of death, is very like vnto this: for we tremble, but we know not wherefore. If any man ſhould aske vs the queſtion, we coulde make no anſwer: and if others ſhould take vpon them to teach vs how to auoid this feare, we cannot conceiue it, let him ſpeake neuer ſo plainely. Wee are very like herein to little children,<note place="margin">A fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer this ignorance.</note> who are skared with a bugge beggar, that is, with a fancy: &amp; yet notwithſtanding, they are oftentimes ſo exceedingly terrified
<pb facs="tcp:23951:183"/>herewith, that when we would we can not ſtill them: for that they are not capable of ſuch reaſons as we alledge to bring them to quietneſſe, and to remooue theſe fooliſh fancies out of their mindes. But if they once come to yeeres and diſcretion, this fond and fooliſh conceit will quickly vaniſh of it ſelfe. In like maner,<note n="2" place="margin">Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe maketh vs to feare death.</note> the terrour and dread we haue of death, proceedeth of nothing, but of our ignorance and want of ſound iudgement. For if we did once knowe what death is, and if for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, wee would ſearch the ſcriptures, which is the ſchoole of the holy ghoſt, and then ſtedfaſtly beleeue whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we finde there, which is prooued vnto vs by ſo many ſound reaſons, then ſhould wee eaſily perceiue what a weake foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation this great feare hath, which doth ſo aſtoniſh our mindes, whenſoeuer we thinke of it, or heare it talked of by other men.</p>
               <p>Whenſoeuer death preſenteth it ſelfe vnto vs,<note n="3" place="margin">The better to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this fear from vs, wee muſt compare this life with death.</note> it hath a maske or viſour on the face thereof, and we are wonderfully daunted in the beholding ſo grimme and terrible a countenance, and runne from it, as from ſome infernall and helliſh monſter: but if we would plucke vp good hearts, and come neere vnto it, and pluck of the viſour, we ſhal euidently perceiue, that it is a verie friend and well willer towards vs. For the better manifeſtation hereof, I will make a briefe compariſon betweene that, and this preſent life, which we loue ſo exceedingly, and are ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enamoured of: to the ende, that the benefites we receiue of each,<note place="margin">Firſt our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and what we are from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof.</note> being compared together, we may the more euidently perceiue which is moſt friendly, and beſt affectionate to vs. Let vs begin with our conception, and that time when as we firſt take life vvithin the bellies of our mothers. We are conceiued in ſinne, that is to ſay, we are infected, accurſed, abhominable, wicked, diſloyall, vngratefull, trecherous, rebellious, enuious, proud, boaſters, diſobedient to parents, murmurers, impatient, without naturall affection, vnmercifull, blaſphemers, haters, and contemners of God and all goodneſſe. In a vvorde, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more like to the deuill then vvee are at our firſt concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he is called our father by reaſon of the great ſimilitude and likeneſſe that is betvveene vs. Beholde novv, our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the life vve leade before vvee are borne. Whereas on the contrarie, vvhen vve die, vve are deliuered from this filth and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23951:183"/>corruption, and waſhed from all our blackneſſe, and mades as white as ſnow. We are no longer carnall, but ſpirituall:<note place="margin">Our happie eſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen oppoſed againſt our miſerie in earth.</note> there is no more contradiction betweene God and vs, nor any thing that may withdraw our loue and affection from him: we feele no more the ſtings of death and prickes of ſinne: we are no longer miſtruſtfull of his promiſes, or diſobedient to his lawes: we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume no more of our owne ſtrength and abilities, nor put any confidence in the helpe of any creature. And to conclude, there will be no more any occaſion of repentance, nor cauſe, why wee ſhould put on ſackecloth, and ſprinkle our heads with aſhes, in token of our humiliation, and hearty ſorow for our ſinnes, but we ſhalbe repleniſhed with ioy and gladneſſe, &amp; be continually praiſing our good God, who hath vouchſafed vs ſuch mercy, as to place vs againe in our former innocency, and make vs like vnto his bleſſed angels. Though there were no other reaſon but this, were it not ſufficient to remooue all feare of death from vs? but we doe ſo little account of our integritie, righteouſneſſe, and perfection in heauen, that we had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in our dregges, then to the end we may pleaſe and ſerue God the better, to come out of that ſtinking puddle,<note place="margin">Secondly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our birth in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</note> wherein we haue taken ſuch pleaſure and delight. Next vnto our concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enſueth our birth, which is neuer a jotte more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for vs. For being once come into the worlde, we are borne to miſery, which ſo attendeth on vs, that it neuer leaueth vs, vntil we be brought to our graues. Which we foreſeeing as it were, by a naturall inſtinct, maketh vs to weepe and crie preſently as ſoone as we are come into the world. But death is farre more gracious and beneficiall vnto vs: for being not content to ende our ſorowes, it regenerateth vs, if we may ſo ſpeake, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs to a perpetuall and euerlaſting happineſſe.<note place="margin">Thirdly our actuall life.</note> After our birth, followeth the reſt of our daies, and the whole courſe and continuance of our liues, which I pray you,<note place="margin">Our ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> let vs a little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We liue in ſuch ignorance, that we neither know God nor his workes, and yet his wiſdome, his bounty, his power, his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, his mercy, is very apparant and continually before our eies. There is no creature bee it neuer ſo little, but declareth and ſheweth them foorth dayly and hourely: yea the very emmate and fly, and the teates of the nources which giue vs ſucke.
<pb facs="tcp:23951:184"/>Notwithſtanding we neither haue eyes to ſee, eares to heare, nor hearts to perceiue, much leſſe any tongues to declare ſuch wonderfull things. He hath created vs, he hath nouriſhed vs, he hath defended, he hath clothed, he hath taught &amp; inſtructed vs: he leadeth vs in the day by the light of the ſunne, &amp; in the night by the brightnes of the moone, and continually guideth vs by his holy ſpirit: if we fall, he helpeth vs vp: if we ſtagger, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs: if we be ſicke, he viſiteth vs, &amp; being recouered, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs: if we wander or go aſtray, he bringeth vs home &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs afterwards in our right way: he ſaueth vs at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, going and comming, and whetherſoeuer we turne he is ready to meete vs, &amp; to accompany vs whetherſoeuer we go: &amp; we can not haue either ſeruant, kinſman or friend, that can be ſo neceſſarie about vs,<note place="margin">Our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> or ſo willing to help vs. We driue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; yet he returneth againe: we offer him wrong, &amp; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth it: we doe not regard him, and he is content to winke at it, and in recompence of all his great fauours &amp; mercies, we ſtill commit ſinne and wickedneſſe, and will not acknowledge his great loue and affection towardes vs:<note place="margin">We neither know God nor our ſelues</note> and as we know not God nor his benefits, ſo will we needs be ignorant of thoſe imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions &amp; vices which are in vs. We thinke we are ſomething, &amp; indeed we are nothing: we thinke we are wiſe, and yet we are fooles: we thinke we are vertuous, and we are vicious: we are worth nothing, and yet we will compare with God. Beholde here, in what maruelous ignorance we liue while we are in this world: but when as by death we are entred into the kingdome of heauen, we ſhall then ſee God face to face: we ſhall knowe the great ſecrets and miſteries of his deuine power: the riches of his graces ſhall be made manifeſt vnto vs, and we ſhall haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to behold them at our pleaſure and eaſe: nothing ſhall be kept from vs that may increaſe our happines, or bring content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our mindes. We ſhall know likewiſe, that we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by his grace, which is all in all, and that by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he hath elected vs, and by his goodneſſe called, iuſtified, and glorified vs.<note place="margin">Of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall travell both of body and mind.</note> We ſhall no more rob him of his glory, nor be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and ſeeke for his honour: for we ſhall know our ſelues and him likewiſe. Furthermore, we liue here alwaies with great trauell of body &amp; torment of minde: we muſt build houſes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23951:184"/>to lodge our ſelues, &amp; to lay in our cattell which til our grounds: and we muſt gather the fruite thereof in ſommer to nouriſh vs in winter. We muſt walke to keepe vs in health, eate and drinke to make vs ſtrong, heate vs in winter, and coole vs in ſommer, bruſh our garments, wipe our ſhoes, go to the markets and buy our meates, dreſſe them, ſeeth them, and make our fires, and all this is not the hundreth part of all thoſe miſchiefes, toyes, and trifles that we are compelled to endure, to prouide for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſities of this miſerable life,<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiee in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> which we ſo highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of: beſides the particular paines that euery man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take in his vocation and ſtate whereto he is called. For ſome go to the warres, and ſome to the Court, ſome trauell to fayres and markets, and others to the ſea about their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe: one is a husbandman, an other a taylour or a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, another a fourbuſher and a ſcourer of harneſſe and olde ſwordes: ſome are ioyners, turners, pointmakers, glouers, painters, apple-mongers and cryers of oyſters about the ſtreets. And who is able to rehearſe all the ſhiftes and deuiſes that men haue founde out to gaine a peny for the maintenance of their liues: and yet doe they inuent dayly more and more to helpe themſelues, and to ſatisfie their owne curious humours.

What ſundry ſauces haue cookes deuiſed to pleaſe mens taſtes: what pictures, images, formes and faſhions vpon their baked meates? there is nothing but the folly of man will counterfait: and it ſeemeth, that as though God had not appointed them ſufficient neceſſarie labour to put them in minde of their ſinnes, they will needes conſume their bodies in fruitleſſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which they take in hande to ſatisfie their owne fooliſh humours. And although the labour of the body in this life be exceeding great, and deuided, as it were, into
<pb facs="tcp:23951:185"/>diuers kindes as we haue already declared,<note place="margin">Of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite cares of the mind.</note> yet is it nothing if it be compared with thoſe infinite ſorrowes, vexations, and tormentes, whereto the minde is continually ſubiect. For beſides that the body betaketh it ſelfe vnto nothing, whereto the minde conſenteth and agreeth not, communicating hereby of all the ſeuerall paines and labours thereof: there are ouer and beſides infinite cares and ſollicitudes of the minde, which are proper and peculiar vnto it ſelfe: as the ſtudie of the liberall artes: diſtruſt, feare, Iealouſie, loue, hatred, deſire, ambition, reuenge, pittie, enuie, compaſſion and ſorrowe: and that which is worſt of all, the ſting and pricke of a guiltie conſcience: and this is one part of that paine and miſerie that euery man, of what eſtate and condition ſoeuer he be, muſt needes endure in this poore and miſerable life: from which not one can be exempted but by death, which relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both body and ſoule of this torment, and bringeth them to a bleſſed and a peaceable reſt. For the one of them is laide in the ground, there to ſleepe vntill the reſurrection, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is aſcended vp to heauen: where it neither thinketh, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſeeth, or feeleth any thing, but that which miniſtreth comfort and conſolaton, and looſeth in a moment whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before vexed or tormented it.<note place="margin">Of ſundry diſeaſes.</note> The other euill and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie that accompanieth this life, is the multitude and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of diſeaſes, whereto we are ſubiect. We are troubled with feuers, chollickes, goutes, plureſies, ruines, fluxes of the bodie, apoplexies, the ſmall poxe, ſcurfes and ſcalles. And in a worde, there is neither countrey, eſtate, citie or towne, age nor part of mans body, which hath not his particular malla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſeuerall diſeaſes. God knoweth what a number of Rheubarbs, gliſters, purgings, lettings of blood, ſweates, and ſundry other remedies we muſt take to preuent theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diſeaſes, and the torment the poore bodie endureth in taking of ſo many receites: and the paines that the phiſitian and ſeruants take about ſicke perſons: the one in preſcribing of potions and preſeruatiues againſt their malladies, the other in watching and attending in the time of their ſickneſſe, dayly and hourely, at all times and ſeaſons. The feares, the cries, the ſorrowes and ſobbes wherewith their friends are in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23951:185"/>manner vexed, if they be in any danger: and the great miſchiefes that often fall out in noble houſes by ſudden death. For the auoiding of all which miſeries, there is no way but death, which maketh an end of all, by laying our bodies in the earth, and preparing them in a readines to put on incorruption, and immortallitie, where neither the ayre, nor meates, nor drinkes, time, nor any thing whatſoeuer ſhall make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any more inconueniences.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, wee liue here continually in broyles,<note place="margin">Of warre.</note> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and warres. There is no countrey nor kingdome, which is not toſſed and troubled with outragious ſtormes and tempeſtes: kinges againſt kinges, and nations againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cities againſt cities, and one againſt another, the <hi>Guelph</hi> againſt the <hi>Gibelin,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſſer</hi> againſt the <hi>Almaine,</hi>

And if we would conſider withall the contentions among men about matters of profite,<note place="margin">Sectes.</note> or the diuerſities of religions, and the continuall heart-burning, which Sathan, that olde murthere of mankinde, cauſeth to ariſe among men to make all the worlde in an vproare, and to make a generall confuſion of all things, the ambition, pride, and immoderate deſires of our fleſh, which doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually blowe the coales and kindle the fire, that it can not goe out, we would ſay it were impoſſible that there ſhould be any peace here vpon the earth: neither in kingdomes by reaſon of the ambition of Princes: neither among cities becauſe of their ſtrife and emulation, nor among citizens by reaſon of their couetous mindes and greedie deſires: nor among ſeruants, by reaſon of their enuy, nor yet among the partes of a mans owne body, by reaſon the one halfe is fleſh and the other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Is it not much better then, that men ſhould quickely die, then liue long in this worlde, conſidering that our liues are nothing but warres, ſtrifes, diſſentions, and debates, as wee haue alreadie prooued: and that on the contrarie, death brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it ſo great reſt, peace, and quietneſſe? beſides all theſe, we are ſubiect to a thouſand temptations. The deuill is
<pb facs="tcp:23951:186"/>on the one ſide forging and deuiſing of ſundrie wyles to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile vs,<note place="margin">Of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, of the world &amp; our fleſh, of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and adverſitie.</note> and framing of many engines and ſnares to entrap vs: and beeing very ſubtill and his craftes-maſter, he turneth his coate and transformeth himſelfe into an angell of light, to the ende wee ſhould not miſtruſt him, and that thereby hee might catch vs the more eaſily. On the other ſide is the world, wherein we are compelled to dwell, which ſometime ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs faire, and ſometime threateneth vs, to trie and aſſay if either by feare or hope it may catch vs at aduantage; and therewithall is vnited and conioyned our fleſh, which neuer leaueth vs, and which by flattering wordes, pleaſant deuices, and manifold allurements doeth ſo charme and bewitch vs, that wee haue no power to denie any thing that it demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of vs. And if it fortune that we be ſo harde hearted at any time as to denie her requeſtes, ſhee weepeth preſently, and maketh ſuch a pitifull complaint, that we are forced forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to alter our purpoſe. Furthermore, we haue friendes, honours, riches, pleaſure and proſperitie on the one ſide, and enemies, diſhonour, contempt, pouerty, and aduerſitie on the other ſide, that deuiſe and practiſe all meanes poſſible to turne vs from the feare and obedience we owe vnto our God. And there is no difference betweene them, but that the one vſeth mildneſſe and gentleneſſe, and the other rigour and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Seeing then that our liues are ſubiect to ſo many dangers, and, as it were, aſſailed on euery ſide, either by furious and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell enemies, or elſe by diſſembling and flattering friendes, who are worſt of all, wee may and that with great reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that death is farre better, which freeth vs from all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not onely of ouercomming, but alſo of attempting and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailing.<note n="4" place="margin">Hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the pleaſures of this life are vaine, and therefore the feare we haue to looſe them is meere va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, wee liue here continually in maruelous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment: and (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) when we haue diligently conſidered whatſoeuer is vnder the Sunne, wee ſhall finde that all is vanitie and vexation of minde.

               <p>The Church may very fitly becompared vnto ſome great and noble princeſſe,<note n="7" place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ioy which the children of God haue after they be once dead, ſhould abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all feare of death.</note> who leauing her cuntry and acquaintance where ſhe hath long inhabited, and bene very much conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, goeth to ſeeke the King her husband, who keepeth his Court in his owne kingdome a farre off, aſſoone as ſhe entreth within the territories and dominions of her lord, all the townes whereſoeuer ſhe paſſe, receiue her with eloquent orations, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and rich preſents, great and ſumptuous feaſts, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ioyfull acclamations: and there is not ſo little or poore a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, but is very forward in making of ſome externall ſhevve of in ward ioy and gladnes for her comming.

               <p>We liue alſo here vnder the tyranie of the deuil, ſinne, death, and the world:<note n="8" place="margin">Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tyranny &amp; placeth vs vnder the moſt happie gouernment that may be, and therefore we neede not feare it.</note> for though we be franchiſed, &amp; deliuered by the death of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> yet not withſtanding we do not fully enioy this libertie, neither are we ſo abſolutely deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thoſe tirants afore named, but that they will be ſtill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and diſquieting vs, ſo long as we liue here below, within their kingdoms &amp; dominions.

All which being conſidered, I would faine knowe what reaſon we can alledge, why we ſhould feare death, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in this world. And which of theſe I pray you are the wiſeſt in their wiſhes and deſires, either <hi>S.

For ſo the promiſes of God, which are ſo ample and exceeding great, could not be accompliſhed; we could not attaine the end of our hope, nor enioy the benefits of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and the inheritance which he hath purchaſed for vs by his death and paſſion,<note n="9" place="margin">Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth vs from infinite euils, &amp; pus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in poſſeſſion of inſpeakable pleaſures.</note> which is the effectuall meanes to bring vs to the ful fruition and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ioy and comfort whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>While we liue here, we are abſent from God, as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, for we walke by faith and not by ſight: and aſſoone as we are dead, we are abſent from the body, and preſent with God himſelfe: we are grieued, and we ſorow vnder the burthen

We liue here to periſh in the wildernes, &amp; to conuerſe among ſauadge and wild beaſts, in the midſt of a thouſand dangers, which do inuiron vs of all ſides: and we depart from hence to liue in paradiſe with our friendes in all ſecuritie and abundance: this life putteth vs into priſon, and death deliuereth vs from thence. While we liue here, we endure froſt and cold, ſtormes and tempeſts: and aſſoone as we are dead we preſently perceiue the pleaſant ſpring time, which bringeth vs more ioy &amp; comfort, then all the other hard ſeaſons brought vs ſorrowe and vexation. We liue here like ſubiects, and by death we are made kings. We liue here with barbarous, cruell, malicious, proud, couetous, and contentious infidels, which do exceedingly offend vs, and we are wonderfully offenſiue vnto them: and whenſoeuer we die, we are aſſured to be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of holy, iuſt, pitifull, milde, merciful, and peaceable ſoules, which are cleane and pure in heart, to whome wee doe great pleaſure, and of whome wee receiue infinite ioy, comfort, and commodity. We are mortall ſo long as we are in the world, and we liue in continuall dread and feare of death: but wee are no ſooner out of this world, but we are immortall, and aſſured of euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>If all this be true, is it not a verie ſtrange thing,<note n="10" place="margin">The feare of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of infidelitie, &amp; therefore it ought to be reiected.</note> that wee can not be brought to beleeue it: or if we doe beleeue it, wee are ſo ſlenderly perſwaded of the truth, that it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take from vs the feare of this death, which is ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and bleſſed a thing, nor the ſorrow for this life, which breedeth in vs ſuch immeaſurable ſorrowe and torment? And it is maruelous to conſider, that wee deſire ſo earneſtly to liue at eaſe, and without care: and yet wee ſeeke by all meanes poſſible to auoide death, which is the onely way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh our deſires. Such as are merily diſpoſed and pleaſant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, will often ſay, that God fauoureth a man when as he
<pb facs="tcp:23951:189"/>taketh away his wife, eſpecially if ſhe be euill and of bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Which if it be true, I may ſafely ſay, that God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a maruelous grace vpon vs, and doeth vs the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that is, when as by death hee deliuereth vs from our fleſh, which is the moſt treacherous and diſloyall wife that can be: and which doth ſo torment the poore minde, with whom ſhee is maried, that ſhe vexeth and diſquieteth her ſilly hushand with the greateſt and moſt intollerable griefe that may be.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may anſwere and ſay, though for the reaſons alreadie alledged the naturall death may ſeeme to be tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">

As concerning thoſe puniſhments which are inflicted by the magiſtrate for the maintenance of peace and quietneſſe in the common-wealth, and the preſeruation of a well, and it is ſtate and gouernment, we may auoide them if we will, and it is our fault if we haue any cauſe to feare them. For as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith, Princes are not to be feared for good workes, but for euil. Wilt thou then be without feare of the power? do well, ſo ſhalt thou haue praiſe of the ſame. For hee is the miniſter of God for thy wealth: but if thou doe euill, feare: for he beareth not the ſword for naught. For he is the miniſter of God to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him that doth euill. It is very apparant then, that if we will liue orderly and obediently vnder our kings and princes, and be contented to be ruled by their lawes, we may eaſily be freed from that feare which thieues, pyrats, murtherers, and ſuch like malefactours haue of iuſtice and good orders.<note n="2" place="margin">

A certaine tyrant, who was at that preſent governour of Cappadocia, to proove whether he coulde make the Chriſtians abjure their religion or not, commaunded that they ſhoulde bee ſet ſtarke-naked in a verie extreeme colde night, in the middeſt of the market place of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and a great fyre to bee made within ſome hundred paces of them, whereat it ſhoulde bee lawfull for ſuch to warme them, as woulde renounce their faith and forſake Chriſt Ieſus: notwithſtanding every one of them did vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly and conſtantly endure all the tormentes of this newe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed puniſhment, except one, who beeing more delicate and thender then his fellowes, went to warme him at the fire thereby to ſave his life: which when the executioner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being in a marveilous rage, and admiring the conſtancie of the others, ranne incontinently and tooke the place of this naked and poore <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> crying out that hee was become a Chriſtian, and humbly thanked God that hee had vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to allow him a place among his witneſſes. By theſe &amp; ſundry other examples we may eaſely geſſe, in what eſtimation Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome was among thoſe of olde time. It is not then to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but to be deſired, and wee may account our ſelves moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, if it pleaſe God to call vs vnto it.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, will not <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> haue vs take heede of men? Doe not the Scripture reach vs to this ende, that they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23951:190"/>are Wolves, Loyons, Bulles, Serpentes, and madde dogges?<note n="2" place="margin">Tyrants haue no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their infirmities declared by many places of Scripture.</note> that their throate is an open ſepulchre? that deciete is in their tongues? that the poyſon of Aſpes is vnder their lippes? that their mouthes are full of curſing? that their feete are ſwift to ſhedde blood? that they have not knowen the way of peace? that thefeare ofGod is not before their eyes? and many ſuch like ſpeeches vttered by the Spirite of God, to forewarne vs of their malice and crueltie, to the ende we ſhoulde avoyd them. Whereto I agree and I muſt needes confeſſe, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this worlde (the devill excepted) that is more treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, malitious or daungerous, then men. But the better to comforte vs againſt their malice, wee muſt conſider on the other ſide their infirmities and weakeneſſe, and that they haue no ſuch power to execute their wicked purpoſes,<note place="margin">Eſay 2.22.</note> as they haue will and deſire to deviſe and effect them.

There is nothing more certen, then that which the Prophete ſpeaketh in this place, touching the lives of the braveſt and gallanteſt men in the earth, who are ſo fraile, that if their breath bee ſtopped but a quarter of an houre, they are ſtifeled and ſtrangled foorthwith: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, like ſuperbious and proude tyrantes, they never enter into the conſideration hereof, that thereby they may abate their pride and plucke downe their ſtomacks: neither do we conſider of it as we ſhould doe; if we did, it would be a very effectuall means to moderate thatfeare, which we haue by reaſon of their threats and menacing ſpeeches. If a Captaine or ſouldier that marcheth in the field, ſhould be afraid of every cracke, or of the ſmoke of every chimney, or of the pricks of every buſh, or of the bees that are gathering hony among the ſweet &amp; pleaſant flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the clattering of the armour or weapons, the ſhaking of the ſwords and neighing of horſes, ſhould he be accounted coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; valiant? no ſurely, neither yet ſhal we be reputed hardy, if we tremble ſo exceedingly at the grim cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenances &amp; braving ſpeeches of cruell tyrants?

Pſalm. We may then well perceive hereby, that there is no ſuch reaſon why we ſhould feare their perſecutions, or any thing elſe that man, which is a worme of the earth, can deviſe for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods trueth and religion.</p>
               <p>Now as all their furie and madneſſe ought not to aſtoniſh vs,<note n="3" place="margin">The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the power of God, ought to aboliſh the feare of perſecutions.</note> conſidering the ſmall power and abilitie they haue to hurt vs, if it be not given them from above: So likewiſe this is a very ſtrong and forceable argument to comforte vs, that wee are prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and environed on all ſides with the favour and power of the Almightie God, who is able to defende and keepe vs from all perill and daunger whatſoever. And this was all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hee alleadged vnto the Prophete <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 1.8.</note> when as hee ſent him vnto the Kinges of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and vnto the Princes and high Prieſtes, to denounce vnto them the judgementes of God, and the miſeries that were prepared for them.

By faith the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed through the redde ſea, and the riuer of <hi>Iorden,</hi> and the waters fled backe, as though they had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, and the mountaines ſhaked and trembled at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

<pb facs="tcp:23951:194"/>at the blowing of the trumpets, which had as great force at that preſent, as all the double cannons in the world can haue. By faith the children of God haue ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſnes, obtained the promiſes, ſtopped the mouthes of lyons, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, of weake were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in battell, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flight the armies of the aliants, the women receiued their dead raiſed to life: other alſo were racked, and would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, that they might receiue a better reſurrection. Wee may ſee by theſe examples, the great force of faith, and of the prayers of the children of God, when ſo euer they are in any neceſſitie. For being armed with ſuch weapons, they are not onely able to fight againſt men, but euen againſt death it ſelfe. Why then are we afraid of euery blaſt that commeth from their mouthes, and ſo aſtoniſhed, as though the thunder it ſelfe were readie to fall vpon our heads?</p>

And euen as wee ſee in the ſeaſons of the yeere, that from the beginning vnto the ending, they are appointed of God; and that in ſuch ſorte, that all the men in the worlde, though they ſhould employ all their whole force, counſels, and indeauours to the contrarie, were not able to alter them: In like manner may we be aſſured, that our liues are ſo limited and bounded by God, that neither King nor Prince, power, nor potentate, can any manner of waies ſhorten or prolong them: yea and that which may wonderfully comfort vs, ſo often as wee remember it, that GOD doeth oftentimes prolong our daies by the meanes of wicked tyrants, which would cut them off.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23951:194"/>demonſtration can wee haue of the prouidence of God; and that the hearts of Princes are in his handes, and that hee can mollefie or harden them, turne them and bende them which waie ſo euer it pleaſeth him? <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">The three young men.</note> who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was ſo furious and ſo raging againſt the three young men, of whome <hi>Daniel</hi> maketh mention, that all his tormentours and executioners could not make a fire hoate enough, and to his liking for to burne them: neither yet were quicke and readie enough to eaſt them into the hoate bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furnace, was the firſt that ſpake of their deliuerance, and that hurnbled him ſelfe before the LORDE to praiſe him, and to acknowledge his power and might, which a little before hee had ſo arrogantly diſdained and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.

The confidence which we repoſe in them is alwaies vaine, for that they neither can nor will doe any good. And the feare wee haue of them is very fooliſh, for that
<pb facs="tcp:23951:195"/>they cannot hurt vs, what will and deſire ſo euer they haue thereto.</p>
               <p>We beleeue and confeſſe al this, when ſo euer we here it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.<note n="10" place="margin">We muſt needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne our ſelues of cowarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, ſeing ſo many reaſons and examples will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs.</note> And oftentimes while wee haue theſe conſiderations in our hearts, we imagine that though all the world ſhould aſſaile vs, yet we would be invincible. And for all this, as ſoone as wee heare any noiſe or bruit, though it be a falſe alarme, our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage preſently faileth vs. We are like vnto the hare, whom, as the tale goeth, the foxe reproouing on a certaine time for his great cowardiſe, ſaying, that conſidering he had ſuch harneſſe, ſuch ſtrength, and agilitie of bodie, hee might fight with the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt and cruelleſt beaſts of the world; and therefore his friendes wondered that he ſhould be ſo fearefull and timerous, running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the barking of euery little dogge: whereto the hare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee could not denie but that which hee ſpake was true, and that oftentimes, when he conſidered ſo much with him ſelfe, hee was fullie reſolued to fight with the dogges, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but yet he had found by experience, that his heart would not ſerue him: for as ſoone as he heard the hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in the woods, he preſently forgat all his ſtrength, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred nothing but running away. This may be excuſable in a hare, which is but a poore beaſt: but in a Chriſtian, who ought alwaies to remember the worde of God, who ſhould meditate day and night in his lawe, and haue it continually before his eyes: and furthermore who hath the Holy Ghoſt as a ſealed writing, which doth continually ſuggerate and teach him what ſo euer is neceſſarie to comfort him: it is a marueilous ſhame and infamie to be ſo fearefull without cauſe, and to forget that helpe and ſtrength in his need,<note n="11" place="margin">The feare of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon whoſe faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſewe ought to leane, ſhould chaſe away all feare of the rage of our enemies.</note> which is moſt auaileable againſt all power and puiſſance what ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>But I pray you, let vs conſider our follie yet a litle more. What is it that we are afraid of? that mortall men, who haue no power of them ſelues, ſhould beat vs and whippe vs for ſpeaking and defending the truth; and in the meane while, we neuer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that for concealing and diſſembling of it, God threatneth to kill vs, who hath power and abilitie to caſt both bodie and ſoule into hell. If I ſhould aſke this queſtion, whether the King or ſome pettie gentleman were moſt to be feared, euery man could
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23951:195"/>anſwer me very readily. But demanding the ſame thing, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God and man, euery one is whiſt, and ſaith not a worde. O Lord, how ſottiſh we are! Doe we not know what to loue, or what to hate? what to followe, or what to flie? what to hope for, or what to feare? Let vs further conſider what iniurie we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto God; which is farre greater then that which ſhould be offered vnto a captaine, who hath the keeping of ſome frontiere towne, of whoſe fidelitie we doubt not, neither that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it to the enemie. For if we would doubt of the truth of any ſuch man, there were alwaies ſufficient reaſon why we might doe ſo, conſidering that naturally wee are not onely lyers, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, variable, and inconſtant, but alſo couetous: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubiect to be eaſily corrupted. Which can not poſſibly agree with the nature of our God. Whereupon it followeth, that they blaſpheme him, and offer him vnſpeakeable iniurie, that will call his trueth into queſtion, fearing leaſt he ſhould breake his worde, or that contrarie to his promiſe, hee would deliuer his children into the hands of their enemies.</p>
               <p>But ſome will anſwer, and ſay,<note n="12" place="margin">Seeing we muſt needes die, martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is moſt honourable, and nothing more glorious then to die in the time of perſecution.</note> doe we not knowe that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue beene baniſhed, impriſoned, whipped, and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the moſt of them moſt cruelly executed?

If then we muſt needes die; is it not much better that wee ſhould ende our liues honourably in the warres, then cowardly in our beddes?

Auguſtine</hi> comparing in one of his epiſtles,<note n="13" place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the truth of God and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his Church is ſuch, as wee ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, euen with the loſſe of our liues.</note> Chriſtian ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to <hi>Helein,</hi> ſaith one thing that is well worthie to be often remembred, and that is; that the one of them is farre more beautifull, then the other. And if then there were a hundred thouſand <hi>Greekes,</hi> that expoſed them ſelues to all daungers, in defence of the honour and beautie of <hi>Helein:</hi> What ſhall Chriſtians doe for the eternall worde of God, vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and knowledge whereof, their life and happines doeth wholly depende? Moreouer it hath beene alwaies eſteemed and commended for a very honourable thing, in all magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious mindes, to die for their countries: howe precious then is the death which wee ſuffer for the building of the Church of God: and howe profitable vnto vs is that blood, which we ſpill to water the roores thereof, to the ende that the young plants and nurſeries which are there, may fructifie and growe the better?</p>
               <p>But doe we giue our liues for nothing?<note n="4" place="margin">The great rewarde wee haue of God for a ſmall gift.</note> Truely we haue great occaſion to pray heartely that we may exchaunge this worne and torne life, for an immortalitie, which is made of ſuch dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent ſtuffe, that ſhall neuer be conſumed nor worne out. Doe wee looſe much, if wee leaue an olde and ſtinking pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for what elſe are theſe earthly bodies) to gaine an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting habitation in the heauens? If wee ſhould not excuſe this exchange with the magnificence and exceeding bountie of our God, hee might be thought to be but an euill husbande, to giue away ſo much, and receiue ſo little? Wee haue nothing then to ſay for our ſelues, why we ſhould not (following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Saint Paul)</hi> runne with patience the race that is ſet before vs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.2.</note> looking vnto <hi>Ieſus</hi> the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the ioye that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed not the ſhame, and is ſet at the right hande of the throne of God.<note place="margin">Iam. 4.7.</note> Let vs reſiſt the deuill, as <hi>Saint Iames</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:23951:196"/>ſaith, and hee will flie from vs. For he is of the nature of the crocodile, that is very fierce in purſuing of ſuch as runne from him, and a ſtarke cowarde to thoſe that purſue him.</p>
               <p>If men of warre be in any ſtrong and well defenced cities,<note n="15" place="margin">Thoſe that are in the Church of God, are invincible.</note> they ſcorne and mocke thoſe that come to beſiege them: what ſhall wee doe then beeing in Ieruſalem, that is to ſay, the Church, which is the beſt walled, the beſt prouided, and the moſt carefully garded of all others? for he that keepeth it, ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth neither day nor night. If of olde time thoſe ſouldiours that were vnder the leading of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> were accounted inuincible; what ſhall wee thinke of thoſe that are vnder the conduct of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus?</hi> The Martyrs of our Lord and Sauiour (ſaith <hi>Cyprian)</hi> may be ſlaine, but they cannot be ouercome but are inuincible: for that they are not afraid, nor terrified with death. Let vs ſay then of the tyrants and perſecuters of Gods children, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaide of <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melytus,</hi> that they may kill vs ſome time, if God will giue them leaue, but they ſhall neuer be able to hurt vs.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe,<note n="16" place="margin">The Church of God is puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and repaired by afflictions.</note> there is nothing that doeth more profit the faithfull, either for the mortifying of vice that is in them, and to exerciſe them in all kinde of vertue, then afflictions, and that continuall warre which they haue with Sathan and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. We are like vnto incenſe, which neuer ſmelleth well, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be caſt into the fire: or to mettals, which are neuer well purified before they haue beene in the furnace: or to wheat, which is neuer cleane, before it be well threſhed and fanned: and to be ſhort, there is nothing according to the word of God that doeth more increaſe and ſtrengthen our faith, then croſſes and afflictions. There is no queſtion, but that hee which ſhall read the hiſtories of all times, ſhall eaſilie ſee, that the Church of God euer flouriſhed more in aduerſitie, then in proſperitie. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then hetherto declared,<note place="margin">A concluſion of what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath bin ſpoken agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the feare of perſecutions.</note> that wee ought neither to feare nor flee martyrdome, conſidering the care which God hath ouer vs, and the weaknes and imbecilitie of our enemies to hurt vs, and the force which we haue to reſiſt them, and that great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; happineſſe which we may looke for in the kingdome of heauen, if wee ſuffer tribulations here vpon earth for
<pb facs="tcp:23951:197"/>righteouſnes ſake, and the defence of the trueth: wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that according vnto the example of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> all this great armie of the whole vniuerſall Church, ought to be deuided into three bands: whereof the firſt, which is the old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers raigning nowe in heauen with Chriſt, may ſay: wee haue beene valiant and couragious, to fight the battels of the Lorde: the other which is of young men, who are luſty, freſh and ſtrong, ought to ſay: that we are readie to followe you, and reſolute for to abide all dangers, to continue and maintaine them ſtill: and the third, which is of young children, ſhall ſay: we will continue them after you, by the power and fauour of him, who hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our graundfathers in olde time, and you at this preſent, with ſuch courage and magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>It is nowe high time to draw to an ende,<note place="margin">The laſt part of this booke, which is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall branches.</note> and to ſpeake of the laſt of theſe feares, which we haue: which is, of ſpirituall things; as, of the iudgement of God: of eternall death: of the deuils, and of ſinne. Notwithſtanding, before I goe any further, I muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the reader of this one thing: That whatſoeuer I ſhall ſpeake, touching the diminiſhing of the feare of theſe foure thinges, it doeth nothing appertaine vnto infidels and fleſhly minded creatures: whoſe conſciences doe ſleepe in ſinne, and are poſſeſſed with a lethargie, and a blockiſh forgetfulnes of all their tranſgreſſions, neuer ſo much as once thinking of them, much leſſe ſorowing for them, but ſtudie and deuiſe altogether how to liue at their eaſe and pleaſure; and there is nothing that they are ſo carefull of, as to auoide all thinges what ſo euer may hinder their ioyes and delights. There are ſome alſo, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any mention made of the threatnings of God, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell fire, mocke and ſcoffe at both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereby they euidently declare the ſmall account they make of either, and the colde affection they beare towardes the knowledge of God, and the meditation of his law. Before theſe and ſuch like ſwine, I minde not to caſt theſe precious and inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable pearles: knowing very well, they will treade and trample them vnder their feete, and that what ſo euer can be ſaid, will be but for the increaſe of their impietie, and multiplying of their ſinnes. But I ſpeake nowe vnto ſuch as are vnfained Chriſtians, who carrie with them a reuerend regarde of Gods worde, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23951:197"/>haue an aſſured confidence in his promiſes, not with purpoſe to ſooth them vp in their ſinnes, to flatter them &amp; lay cuſhions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their elbowes, not to excuſe their faultes, or to encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goe on forwarde in their wicked wayes, and ſo to procure the heavie wrath of the Almighty to fall downe vpon them in the day of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his iuſtice: in a word, it is not to harden the heart of the obſtinate to deſpiſe his mercy, his patience and long ſuffring, wherewith he doeth provoke vs daily and hourely vnto repentance and amendment of life: but this is to comfort them, and to raiſe them vp, and, as it were, to lift vp their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, when as they are preſſed downe with the weight of their ſinnes, and with the feare and terror they haue of the terrible and fearefull iudgements of God for their tranſgreſſions. The drift then and whole ſcope of this diſcourſe, is to give a little breath vnto poore and tyred ſoules, which grone vnder the burthen of their ſinnes. For both <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> his promiſes, his Goſpel and al his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolations ſerue eſpecially to this end, to vnburthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that are laden, to comfort the weake, &amp; to heale the broken hearted.</p>

                     <hi>The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt the feare of the anger of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Promiſes that we ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> Chap. 3.17, 18. Rom. 5.16. Chap. 8.33.</note> the greateſt &amp; that which we are moſt afraid of, is the terrible wrath of God. For the feare we haue of death &amp; of the devill proceedeth of nothing but this, that we thinke they are the miniſters &amp; executioners of his iudgements. Againſt this feare we may oppoſe all thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſayings following. God (ſaith <hi>S.

And in the ſame epiſtle in another place: Who ſhallay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that iuſtifieth, who ſhall conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne? It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is dead, yea or rather which is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: who is alſo at the right hand of God, &amp; maketh requeſt alſo for vs. Can we haue a greater aſſurance that we ſhal not be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or if we be, that we ſhalbe acquired &amp; abſolved,<note n="2" place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the love that God beareth vs in his Sonne.</note> then by the mouth of the Iudge himſelf, &amp; by the teſtimony of his holy ſpirit, which is ſo often mentioned in the holy Scriptures?

For there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for al haue ſinned, &amp; are deprived of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, &amp; are iuſtified freely by his grace, through the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 5.8, 9, 10.</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath ſet forth to be a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation through faith in his blood. And furthermore God ſetteth out his love towardes vs, ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for vs; much more being nowe iuſtified by his blood, wee ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, much more being reconciled we ſhall bee ſaved by his life. And to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he ſaith,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.11, 12, 13, 14.</note> Remember that you beeing in time paſt Gentiles in the fleſh, and called vncircumciſion of them, which are called circumciſion in the fleſh made with hands, that ye were (I ſay) at that time without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were aliauntes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23951:198"/>from the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; were ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, &amp; had no hope, &amp; were without God in the world. But now in Chriſt Ieſus, ye which once were farre off, are made nere by the blood of Chriſt. For he is our peace which hath made of both, one, &amp; hath broken the ſtop of the partition wall. And in the beginning of the ſame Chapter.<note place="margin">Verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> You hath he quickned that were dead in treſpaſſes &amp; ſinnes: wherein in time paſt ye walked, according to the courſe of this world, and after the prince that ruleth in the ayer, euen the ſpirit, that now wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the children of diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: among whom we alſo had our conuerſation in time paſt in the luſts of our fleſh, in fulfilling the wil of the fleſh &amp; of the mind: &amp; were by nature the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wrath as well as others. But God which is rich in mercy tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his great loue wherwith he hath loued vs, euen when we we were dead by ſinnes, hath quickned vs together in Chriſt, by whoſe grace ye are ſaued, &amp; hath raiſed vs vp together, &amp; hath made vs ſit together in the heauenly places in Chriſt Ieſus, that he might ſhew in the ages to come, the exceeding riches of his grace through his kindneſſe to wardes vs in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> For by grace are yeſaued through faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God. Not of workes leſt any man ſhould boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> he ſaith.<note place="margin">Chap. 1.19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, &amp; by him to reconcile all things vnto himſelfe, and to ſet at peace through the blood of his croſſe both the things in earth, and the things in heauen. And you which were in times paſt ſtrangers, and enemies, becauſe your mindes were ſet in euill workes, hath he now alſo reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death, to make you holy, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, &amp; without fault in his ſight, If you continue groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; ſtabliſhed in the faith, and be not moued away from the hope of the goſpell, whereof ye haue heard, &amp; which hath bene preached vnto euery creature which is vnder heauen.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Furthermore, the better to aſſure vs againſt the iuſtice of God,<note n="3" place="margin">The ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt Ieſus.</note> we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of the ſatiffactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which his So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; our Mediator hath made vnto him for vs: &amp; the dayly interceſſion, wherby he doth continually turne away his anger from vs, &amp; defendeth our cauſe, to keep vs in fauour with his father. Finally we ought to
<pb facs="tcp:23951:199"/>arme vs with this article of our faith, as with an armour of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proofe, that the Father hath giuen all power vnto his Sonne,<note n="4" place="margin">His inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate ſhall be our iudge.</note> and that hee ſhall come in the latter ende to iudge both the quicke and the dead. I woulde knowe nowe if our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſhoulde be troubled with the feare and apprehenſion of Gods iudgements; having before hand, firſt ſo many promiſes &amp; aſſurances that wee ſhall not bee condemned: Secondly, ſo many teſtimonies of his love, which he hath declared and doeth declare towardes vs, not onely in wordes but alſo in deedes, and thoſe ſo evident, that we neede never doubt of them: Thirdly, his Sonne to be a Mediatour betweene him and vs, who dyed, and was ſacrificed, who hath made interceſſion, hath all power and authoritie, who is a King and a high Prieſt to reconcile vs vnto God his Father, and to quench whatſoever may kindle the wrath of God towardes vs: Fourthly, ſeeing our advocate ſhall be our iudge, who can not be denied of any thing whatſoever he ſhall ordeine &amp; ſtabliſh in favour of his children.<note n="5" place="margin">The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercie of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs many wayes.</note> If vnto theſe we will adde the mercie and favour of God, wherwith the whole world, and eſpecially his houſe, is fully repleniſhed: and conſider withal that we are his children and his inheritance; that we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, fleſh, and bone of his onely beloved ſonne; that we are his people and his ſeruants, and he our Lord and King; and that we are poore infantes, and hee our gardein and tutor; that wee are his beloved ſpouſe, that is, his love and delight; that we are his treaſure and his precious Iewels; that wee are his houſe and garden of pleaſure; that wee are his kinſemen and neere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce, and that hee hath created vs after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his owne image: If wee woulde conſider all this and that wee are his verie heart, and the apple of his eye: Is it poſſible that ever we ſhould imagine him to be a cruell &amp; an inexorable iudge? we would ſurely on the contrary ſeeke for him, love, and embrace him as a very loving,<note n="6" place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted truth of God.</note> gracious, and a pitifull Father. We would not feare leſt he ſhould iudge vs: but we would hope to iudge the world with him. And wherefore ſerve the Goſpel &amp; ſo many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which haue bin preached vnto vs of the grace, mercy, &amp; favor of God, by his Prophets and Apoſtles? what profite alſo ſhould we reape of the alliaunce which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and vs,<note n="7" place="margin">His alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> and that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is come into the worlde

Furthermore, what advantage ſhould we haue, by being at the right hand of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> at the latter day, and that there be a ſeparation betweene the ſheepe &amp; the goats, if al ſhould be ſent to hel? where ſhould be the ioy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, peace, &amp; the glory which God hath promiſed vnto his people? who wil beleeve alſo that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was caried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, that the thiefe entred into paradiſe with <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were opened to <hi>S.

Were it not in vaine &amp; a marveilous abuſe, that the ſonne ſhould beare the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> &amp; of a <hi>Saviour,</hi>
                  <note n="9" place="margin">The name, the obedience and merits of Chriſt Ieſus.</note> if we ſhould be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by the father, &amp; tormented by thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts we haue deſerved by reaſon of our ſinnes? And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: ſhould not he have done very vnwiſely to have ſuffred him ſelfe to be accurſed for vs, &amp; to indure the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t due vnto our iniquities, if he were not able to deliver vs? why ſhould he pay our ranſom, if he ſhuld not come out of captivity? why ſhould he ſpill his blood, and pay for that which he had not taken, (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith) if it were not available to acquite vs? We muſt neceſſarily then conclude one of theſe 3 points: either that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> hath not made a full ſatisfaction for vs, or if he hath, that we ſhal not be condemned; or if we be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, that God is not righteous in his judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. But it were horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to thinke that the Father were vniuſt in his iudgements, or to ſay, that the Sonne had not paid whatſoever was due for vs: &amp; therefore we may ſafely ſay, that we need not feare the wrath of God, or his ſentence at the latter day, ſeeing we live and die in the faith of the death &amp; reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> his ſonne: but we may boldly preſent our ſelves before his face, &amp; beſeech him as did <hi>David,</hi> that he would not enter into judgement with vs, aſſuring our ſelves of the reſt, &amp; that in the name and mediation of his Sonne, he will abſolve vs from al thoſe offences, whereof we are accuſed, either by the devill or our owne conſciences. For

But bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſo dul headed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23951:201"/>as we are, and ſo vnfit to receiue the trueth; it is very good that with the aforenamed places of Scriptures, we alſo ioyne theſe reaſons which followe, to comfort and ſtrengthen vs the more. Wee muſt then conſider, that it is impoſſible we ſhould periſh,<note n="2" place="margin">An aſſured faith in his premiſes of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling.</note> hauing faith; if we will conſtantly perſeuere and keepe it vnto the ende: for that it is the ſeede of life, as contrariwiſe infidelitie is the ſeede of death. As then the infidell can not liue, becauſe of his infidelitie, which ſeparateth him from God: ſo likewiſe the faithfull man can not die, ſo long as by the meanes of his faith he is conioyned and vnited vnto him. Moreouer, faith doth lay hold of the word of God; which word quickneth that which is deade, and calleth thoſe thinges that are not, as though they were. As then we are not afraide,<note n="3" place="margin">The immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth of God.</note> that heauen ſhould fall downe vpon vs and ouerwhelme vs, or that the earth ſhould open and ſwallow vs vp, though either of them haue no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion but onely this word to hold them vp: ſo likewiſe ſhall we not neede to be afraid of death, hauing this diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde in our hearts, which is the fountaine and welſpring of our liues. Furthermore, if we haue faith,<note n="4" place="margin">The grace of God.</note> we haue alſo the grace and preſence of God: we are his children and houſhold ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, wee haue his ſpirit in which all thinges conſiſt.

By faith alſo wee are made members of the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus,<note n="5" place="margin">The life of Chriſt Ieſus is in vs, who are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> bounde and tied vnto him with a moſt ſure knot: by reaſon whereof, we doe participate of that life, which diſtilleth from his diuinitie into his humanitie. As then our heade had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to feare death, hauing life in him ſelfe: ſo likewiſe haue wee no cauſe to ſeare death, hauing life through him. For as the ſappe commeth from the roote of the tree, and ſpreadeth it ſelfe into the braunches; and as in a mans bodie the life floweth from the heart into all the other members: ſo likewiſe doth life flowe from Ieſus Chriſt into all them, who by a liuely ſaith doe remain in the vnion of the Church. <hi>S. Paul</hi> making a compariſon in the epiſtle to the Romanes, betweene our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> and our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſaith, that as death hath power ouer all the

For the experience which we haue of death, to the which we are ſubiect, as children of <hi>Adam</hi> and inheritours of his miſerie, is not more certen, then the aſſurance we haue of eternal life, to the hope wherof we are called by the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> &amp; the grace &amp; mercy, which the father hath ſhewed vnto vs by his meanes. And we neede not dout no more of our reſurrection, then we doe of his: either of ſinne or of death, which through the diſobedience of our forefathers, hath bin ſpread abroad among all his poſteritie. As then, it would be thought a damnable &amp; intollerable pride for any man deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; ſtained with his corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to feare death &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: ſo likewiſe would it be an intollerable diſtruſtfulneſſe for an other, beeing regenerated by the ſpirit of God, &amp; vnited to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> by that faith which he hath in his promiſes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of life euerlaſting.

For what do we beleeue, but that which they haue preached vnto vs? What haue they preached? but that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is come into the world, that he was deſpiſed, that he was dead, &amp; raiſed vp again, to pull vs out of the tyrannie &amp; ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of ſinne &amp; of death, &amp; to purchaſe for vs life euerlaſting?

               <p>I know well that our nature is foulded and wound vp in this cloath of mortalitie,<note n="15" place="margin">Our life is hid in him.</note> whereto it is ſubiect by ſinne.

But for all that, we muſt thinke that it lieth hidden there, and that as yet, the place ſerueth not for the manifeſtation thereof. Who would haue iudged that Chriſt Ieſus ſhould euer haue beene the ſpring of our life, and that it ſhould neuer depart from him, no more then the light and heat departeth from the fire, when as hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the croſſe in the midſt between two the eues, he yielded vp his life into the hands of his Father, and was buried, and that in all things he ſhewed him ſelfe to be the very image and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of weaknes and infirmitie? and yet notwithſtanding that was incloſed in him, that within three daies after did ſo liuely ſhew it ſelfe: when as in deſpight of death and all his enemies, he raiſed vp himſelfe by his owne power. Who would thinke in winter, when as the trees are bare and naked, and when as the ſharpnes of that colde ſeaſon hath plucked off all their leaues, their bloſſoms, and fruits, leauing them nothing but an olde and ſoare skinne or coat, as it were, to couer them, which ſeemeth to be quite deade and withered: who would thinke, I ſay, ſeeing them in ſuch a bare eſtate, that there were any more life in them, and that they ſhould flouriſh and waxe greene againe, yea bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, bud, and bring foorth in their time and ſeaſon, as wee ſee they doe euery yeere?

For as long as the worde of God ſhalbe the worde of life, and that his promiſes ſhalbe infallible to ſo many as beleeue in them, as long as Ieſus Chriſt which was yeſterday, to day, to morrow, and for euer, ſhalbe the bread of life, and the light to ſo many as will follow him: as long as God who dwelleth in his Church as in his houſe, ſhall be the God of the liuing, and a quickning to ſo many as beleeue in him: ſo long as his glorie and loue, whereof all true felicitie dependeth, ſhall neuer be wanting to his children, and that the aliance which hee hath made with his people ſhall be firme and aſſured: ſo long as thoſe who beleeue in him, ſhall not be confounded and deceiued of their hope, and that faith ſhall haue this excellent effect, to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe in whom ſo euer it is rooted and grounded: as long as the remiſſion of ſinnes, the ſanctuarie and refuge of the Church, ſhalbe freely promiſed and performed by the mercie of God, and by the moſt precious bloode of Ieſus Chriſt, to ſo many as ſhall deſire it: ſo long as the obedience of the Sonne of God ſhall be more forceable to pull Chriſtians from death, then is the ſinne of our firſt parents, to throw them headlong into hel: and, to end all in a word, ſo long as our King ſhall haue the keyes of life and death, and power to put all his enemies, as a footſtoole, vnder his feete, wee neede not then be afraide of death, neither yet, which is more, that euer we ſhal die:<note n="18" place="margin">Wee can not dienor be condemned ſo long as our head liueth &amp; remaineth in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> ſeeing we are vnited and firmely coupled vnto him by faith.

It is true, &amp; all this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by reaſon he turned away his heart from God, and from the commandement, which he had giuen him, vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience whereof he ſhould haue liued in a moſt bleſſed &amp; happie eſtate, &amp; would folow his owne fantaſie For in ſtead of the hope he had conceiued, that by this meanes he ſhould become a God, of a man he became a deuil; of vertuous, moſt vicious; of a ſound man, very ſickly; of contented &amp; mery harted, ſorowful &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; of immortall, mortall; of wiſe, fooliſh; of the friend of God, an enemy to all goodneſſe: and in a word, of happy, which hee might well perceiue being in his grace and fauour, being once ſeparated from his preſence, the moſt accurſed and vnhappie creature that could be. Inſomuch, as it was a wonderfull miracle and a notable example of the grace &amp; fauour of God towardes him, that he fell not wholly into deſperation, after ſuch a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous change &amp; alteration of his eſtate &amp; condition. Neither do I doubt, but that if we ſhould truſt in our own power &amp; ſtrength as he did, we ſhould be ſooner ouerthrowne then he was, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that our infirmity is farre greater then his. But that which maketh vs inuincible not only againſt the deuill, but alſo againſt al the world &amp; al other enemies whatſoeuer, is the grace of god, which is far more abundant in vs through Chriſt Ieſus, then euer it was in our firſt pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

                     <hi>Twelue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons added to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rebear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> 1. <hi>Iuſtifying faith.</hi> Chap. 4.</note> wee may likewiſe adde theſe reaſons following. Firſt of all, that we can not be Chriſtians without faith, and that there is no faith without righteouſneſſe for this is the principall and chiefe effect of all other: and as <hi>S. Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in many places of his Epiſtles (and eſpecially to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes)</hi> he which worketh not at all, but only beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth the ſinner, his faith ſhall be accounted vnto him for righteouſneſſe. Now we cannot be accounted righteous and ſinners both together: for theſe are flat contrary and can not be in the ſame ſubiect both at once. We may then ſafely conclude, that either we are without faith: or if we haue faith, that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note n="2" place="margin">Our vnion with Chriſt Ieſus the bead of the Church.</note> we muſt remember, that we are members of the body of Chriſt Ieſus: that is to ſay, of his Church which he hath ſanctified, made holy, and without blemiſh in his ſight. Which can not be without the grace and mercy, which God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed through Ieſus Chriſt, whereby he hath pardoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vs all our ſinnes. For indeede we are not irreprehenſible in his ſight: which thing the Church it ſelfe doeth teſtifie, as well by the confeſſion of her faith which ſhee maketh daily, as alſo by her prayers, deſiring very inſtantly that her treſpaſſes may be forgiuen her. It muſt needes follow then, that if ſhee be holy, as it is in one of the articles of our faith, that it is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23951:207"/>of that excellencie which is in her ſelfe and in euery one of her members, but in reſpect of the grace and mercy of God, who will not impute her ſinnes vnto her.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt not thinke that Chriſt Ieſus is come into the world in vaine:<note n="3" place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt hath not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for nothing, nor is not dead in vain.</note> or that God his Father had appointed him to take vpon him the nature of a man, thereby to become mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ſubiect to many paſſions to no end nor purpoſe: &amp; that he himſelfe would haue ſuffered ſo many ſhamefull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious reproches, ſuch wrongs and iniuries, ſuch griefe and vexation of minde, and in the end ſo cruell and fearefull a death without ſome very great and vrgent occaſion. Can we alledge any other cauſe hereof, but the pity and commiſeration that both the father and the ſonne had of vs, and of that miſerable eſtate and condition wherein we were. For which cauſe the one of them was induced to pardon our offences by his mercie, and the other to die for vs, to the end, that he might ſatisfie for vs, and ſo get pardon for our ſinnes. If then the end of the in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt Ieſus, and of the eternall counſell of God be the deliuerance of his elect, and the remiſſion of their ſinnes, we muſt conclude, that both of them were fruſtrate of their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if our ſinnes be ſtill retained; and if both their intents be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, that then our offences are pardoned. Fourthly,<note n="4" place="margin">The miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> we muſt regard and conſider what is the myſtery and ſignification of our baptiſme. And that God hath ſo expreſſely commanded, that ſo many as will be adopted for his children, ſhould be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with water and baptized: for if the grace of God and the blood of Chriſt Ieſus, whereby we are ſpiritually and inuiſibly waſhed from our ſinnes, are repreſented vnto vs in this holy and viſible ſacrament, and ceremony: if moreouer God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that it ſhould be perpetuall and continue for euer, and be obſerued in his Church, to the ende that by this meanes hee may aſſure all the members thereof of his grace which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them, to clenſe them from their filthineſſe: wee might inferre, that if our ſinnes were not forgiuen vs, hee ſhould be vnfaithfull, and ſhould abuſe vs wonderfully, ſolemnly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vs a thing, which he neither can nor will performe &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh: And furthermore, that our hope ſhould be in vaine to truſt in his promiſes. So long then as God ſhall be true and eternall,
<pb facs="tcp:23951:208"/>and the truſt and confidence which we haue in his worde and mercy, ſhalbe certen and infallible, Chriſtians neede neuer doubt of the remiſſion of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo further conſider, that the end why the ſupper of the Lord is inſtituted,<note n="5" place="margin">The inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the ſupper of the Lord.</note> was for nothing, but to put vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the death and paſſion of Chriſt Ieſus, and to ſet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before our eyes his blood, wherewith the newe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ratified and eſtabliſhed. Now then, it was conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that in that league and alliance, which God hath made with his people, that he ſhould write his lawes in their heartes, and forgiue their ſinnes and iniquities, and neuer remember their tranſgreſſions any more: and therefore we may conclude, that if they were not quite aboliſhed, and blotted out of Gods book, the couenant and alliance ſhould not be ſtrong; and that all this bread &amp; wine which we receiue at the Lords table, ſhould be but ſignes of mockery and deceit.</p>
               <p>The mercy of God alſo is a very forcible argument to perſwade and aſſure vs of the remiſſion of our ſinnes.<note n="6" place="margin">
                     <hi>The mercy of God.</hi> Pſal. 33.57.103.</note> For <hi>David</hi> ſaith not without good cauſe in his Pſalmes, that the earth is full of Gods mercy, that it ſhall continue for euer and, that it reacheth vnto the heauens. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, that he is the father of mercies &amp; the God of all comfort and conſolation. Giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, how mercifull he ſheweth himſelfe vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo long as they are in this world, where they are enuironed about with all ſortes of miſeries, the principall of which, is ſinne. It is requiſite then, that God ſhould pardon vs: for if he ſhould impute out ſinnes vnto vs, the earth (contrary to the propheſie and reuelation of the holy ghoſt) ſhould not be filled with his merites, but with his curſes and maledictions. And as touching himſelfe, he ſhould rather be accounted a God of wrath, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and vengeance, then a God of mercy: for that ſinne, if it be not pardoned, and the wrath of God thereby appeaſed, can bring forth nothing but torment and miſerie.</p>
               <p>The reaſon alſo that is drawne from the faithfulneſſe of God to prooue the remiſſion of our ſinnes,<note n="7" place="margin">
                     <hi>The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of God</hi> Chap. 1.9.</note> is no leſſe auaileable then the former. For if (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle) in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſinnes, he promiſeth to pardon and forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to clenſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe, we ought to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23951:208"/>beleeue him. But if we doubt, it is either by reaſon we thinke he will not ſtand to his promiſe, nor be ſo good as his worde: or elſe for that we thinke he is not able to performe that, which he ſpeaketh: or elſe that he is altered and changed, and repents him of that which before he had ſaid: or elſe that our incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath aboliſhed that faithfull and ſacred promiſe which hee hath made vnto vs either of which we can not doe or thinke without moſt horrible blaſphemy, and moſt execrable impiety. If then we wil retaine a holy opinion of our God as we ought to do,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.7, 8</note> we muſt both liuing &amp; dying beleeue aſſuredly that which <hi>David</hi> ſaith: that mercy is with the Lord, &amp; with him is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and he ſhall redeeme <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his iniquities.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if we can not haue any remiſſion of our ſinnes,<note n="8" place="margin">The force and efficacie of the prayers of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> to what end do we ſo earneſtly, &amp; ſo hartily craue at the hands of almightie God, that it would pleaſe him to forgiue vs our ſins, &amp; to remoue out iniquities out of his ſight? he hath promiſed that in ſeeking for him we ſhall find him, &amp; in asking of whatſoeuer is neceſſary for vs, that we ſhal obtaine it: &amp; likewiſe that his eares are alwaies open &amp; ready to heare the petition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore not doubting of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we daily beſeech him to forgiue vs our debts: ſhould we not then be notably deluded, if he would not vouchſafe to heare vs? &amp; ſhould it not be a flat mockery, firſt to command vs to pray, &amp; ſecondly to promiſe to heare our prayers, if when we haue made our petitions vnto him, &amp; that he hath heard vs, he wil notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding do nothing for vs.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, why is it ſaid in the ſcriptures;<note n="9" place="margin">If we ſhold not be cloſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſinnes and healed of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the name of phiſitian ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly giuen vnto Chriſt.</note> that God healeth vs of our infirmities? why alſo hath Chriſt Ieſus among other his titles named himſelf a phiſitian? was it becauſe he had power to beale the diſeaſes of the body, or rather for that he could cure the ſoule? if is be ſo. I would demand if there be any greater or more dangerous diſeaſe then ſinne? or what is there, that ought ſooner to moue him to pitie vs, or what greater occaſion can be offered him, to ſhe we his skill, his dexterity, his care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence towards vs?

               <p>To what end alſo ſerueth the goſpell, if it were not to clenſe vs from our ſinnes,<note n="10" place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpell.</note> and to reclaime vs from our vaine and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conuerſation? Is it to no ende that it is called the worde of grace, of reconciliation, of ſaluation, and of life: and is the title of glad and ioyfull newes falſely applyed vnto it? why ſhould we thanke <hi>S. Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles for preaching of it, or Chriſt himſelfe for bringing of it? what a folly, or rather, what a madneſſe were it, to ſuffer ſo much vnquietneſſe for preaching of it, and ſpreading of it abroad among all nations: or to endure ſuch torment and martyrdome for the profeſſion &amp; defence thereof? or (to be ſhort) what commoditie ſhall we get by hearing of it, by meditating of it, and laying of it vp in our hearts as incorruptible ſeede: or to ſell all that we haue, and buy this precious and moſt excellent treaſure and pearle, if it were not in the end commodious for vs, able to ſaue our ſoules, and to clenſe vs from all our ſinnes?</p>
               <p>In like maner, if our ſinnes were not forgiuen vs, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould there be betweene vs and the deuils?<note n="11" place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the children of God and of the deuill, which would not be, if god did not pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſinnes.</note> or what had we more then they, that we might inſult ouer them? for if wee will conſider our owne nature, it is altogether filthy and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and without the great mercy of God, there is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie in vs, then is in them. If we would examine our liues and all out thoughts, our wordes, our workes, and call the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our hearts to a reckening, and trie them throughly, we ſhould find that we are maruelous obſtinate and rebellious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and as badde as they: and that we haue nothing whereof we may glory, but onely his mercy, by which it hath pleaſed him to make a difference betweene vs and them, and to exempt vs from their number, giuing vs for the loue and merits of Chriſt Ieſus, a full remiſſion of all our iniquities &amp; offences. Whoſoeuer then would doubt hereof, beſides his vnthankfulnes towards God, in contemning of his benefits, ſhould ſhake hands with the deuil, and become his friend and companion.</p>
               <p>The laſt reaſon to confirme vs, that he will pardon our ſinnes, is the authority which he hath giuen vnto the paſtours &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

For euen as thoſe decrees which are eſtabliſhed in any Court, are confirmed &amp; authoriſed by the king: ſo likewiſe thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences &amp; decrees which are pronounced by the Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable vnto Gods word, are approoued &amp; confirmed by God himſelfe. And thus haue I briefly ſet downe thoſe twelue reaſons or arguments to prooue that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there are many weak &amp; ſcrupulous conſciences which wil hardly be perſwaded hereof,<note place="margin">Remedies againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations which ariſe of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our ſinnes.</note> by reaſon they can not conceiue theſe reaſons before remembred: partly by reaſon of a naturall &amp; ſuperſtitious kind of feare, &amp; partly with I know not what imaginations, wherwith their minds are continually toſſed &amp; tormented, which though they be ſomtime expelled, yet they preſently returne againe &amp; miniſter new occaſions of vexation &amp; ſorow: It ſhalbe very conuenient to touch ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we make an end of this worke, &amp; to refute them as fully and amply as we may.<note n="1" place="margin">Againſt the temptation proceeding of the great number of our ſinnes.</note> Some are afraid of the great number of their ſinnes, &amp; think becauſe they are ſo many, they cannot be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But theſe poore ſoules neuer conſider with themſelues in the meane time how great the liberality of God is to whom it is no greater matter to forgiue ten millions of crowns then one peny: &amp; they do not ſeriouſly ponder the maruelous efficacie &amp; force of the blood of Chriſt Ieſus. For if he were ordained to take away the ſmnes of the whole world, why ſhould he not be ſufficient to heale the ſores of particular ſinners? King <hi>Manaſſes</hi> confeſſing
<pb facs="tcp:23951:210"/>before God, that his ſinnes were multiplied as the ſand of the ſea, yet notwithſtanding deſired God to pardon him.

So that then, this being wel weyed, we need neuer be aſtoniſhed at the multitude of our ſinnes if we wil flee for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto the mercies of God, and neuer doubt of his promiſes.</p>
               <p>Others are wonderfully terrified with the greatneſſe of their ſinnes:<note n="2" place="margin">Againſt the temptation proceeding of the greatneſſe of our ſinnes.

And to what end tendeth the parable of the two debtors, wherof the one ought 500 pence, &amp; the other fifty? &amp; of the creditour, who hauing two debters which had nothing to pay, forgaue them both; if not to ſhewe vnto vs that he is as ready to forgiue the great ſinnes; as well as the ſmall &amp; litle ones, to the end, that it ſhould be an occaſion for vs, by conſidering how much we are bound vnto him, to encreaſe our loue and affection towardes him? Let vs conclude then, that there is no wound ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but the plaiſter of Gods mercy, made with the blood of Chriſt Ieſus his Sonne, will quickly heale and recouer it.</p>
               <p>There is another thing alſo which maketh vs to doubt of the remiſſion of our ſinnes; &amp; that is our continuance in them.<note n="3" place="margin">Againſt the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſinne.</note> For conſidering that by reaſon of the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our nature, which is ſo great &amp; ſo hard to be amended, we can not but thinke often with our ſelues of our great offences towards god, &amp; feare leaſt he will not vouchſafe to pardon ſo many heynous faults, &amp; we

For I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not that which I do: for what I would, that doe I not: but what I hate, that doe I. If I doe then that which I would not, I conſent to the Law, that it is good.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the Apoſtles, who were as godly men as euer were, &amp; who had receiued wonderful mercies at the hands of God, were not exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne after their regeneration, &amp; that euen the deare children of God are often moleſted &amp; troubled with the ſtings and concupiſcences of the fleſh, which do maruelouſly coole the heat of that affection, which ſhould be in them to the ſeruice of God.

Was hee the Phiſitian and Sauiour of his Church no longer then hee walked here vpon the earth? or is he ſo now likewiſe that he is aſcended into heauen? though he hath but once ſhedde his blood for vs, for the ſatisfaction and remiſſion of our ſinnes, doe we not drinke dayly thereof in his ſupper,<note n="6" place="margin">His worde &amp; ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doe aſſure vs of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes.</note> to the ende we may apply it vnto our ſelues, and thereby receiue the fruit and commoditie that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thereof? haue we onely beleeued when we were baptized, &amp; at our firſt entrance into Gods houſe: or being once in, doe we perſeuere vnto the end, and fully beleeue the remiſſion of our ſinnes? If then a Chriſtian obtaineth by faith that which hee beleeueth and hopeth for: we need not doubt, but that if we beleeue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, we ſhall alwaies be forgiuen, and that the remiſſion of our ſinnes ſhalbe as durable, as the grace and mercy of God, the certentie of his promiſes, the power and efficacie of the death of Chriſt Ieſus,<note n="7" place="margin">Such is the faith of the Church.</note> and the faith of his Church, which are the matter and ſubſtance whereof it is compounded. And therefore as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaide to his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that hee had more then one bleſſing, ſo wee may be aſſured at the handes of our heauenly father, to receiue more bleſſings then one, whoſe grace and bounty is ſo abundant, as that it floweth ouer all, and endureth for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>Some there are alſo,<note n="4" place="margin">Againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the diſtruſt of the mercies of God, &amp; of the opinion that ſome haue, how that hee requireth of his children a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</note> who diſtruſt and diſpaire of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and are wonderfully afraide, for that they thinke that hee is alwaies angrie with them: beeing perſwaded that hee requireth a perfect and an abſolute righteouſneſſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23951:212"/>of all his children, and that if we will pleaſe him, wee muſt obſerue whatſoeuer hee hath written in his lawe, doing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe then hee there expreſſely commaundeth. Which if it were true, wee ſhould haue no neede of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which commeth by faith, but onely of that which commeth of the lawe. For as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaieth, thoſe who can fulfill the lawe, ſhall be reputed righteous, and ſhall liue by the workes thereof. But becauſe we can not be iuſtifyed by this meanes by reaſon of the infirmitie and weakeneſſe of our fleſh, which ſo hindreth vs, that we can not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it: and that Chriſt is the fulfilling of the lawe to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as beleeue: and for that this opinion is the principall cauſe of the reiection of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.31.</note> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Who following the lawe of righteouſneſſe, neuer attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereto, becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but by the workes of the lawe: For they haue ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone, as it is written, Beholde, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and a rocke to make men fall, and euery one that beleeueth in him, ſhall not be aſhamed. It is very requiſite then, as well for theſe three conſiderations, as alſo for many others, and eſpecially for the quieting of the conſcience, which in many fearefull natures and religious perſons is exceedingly more tormented herewith then with any thing elſe,<note place="margin">Three eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> to know firſt of all how to pleaſe God, and to doe thoſe things which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto his will and commandement.

And in a word,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.13, 14.</note> that after the example of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> we ſhould forget that which is behinde, and endeauour our ſelues vnto that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke, for the priſe of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.

We may conclude then, that God doeth not require ſuch an abſolute perfection and puritie in man, as that he ſhould be without all ſinne: for that can not be in any but in the Sonne of God <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> but that we will be carefull &amp; deſirous to attaine to a holy and pure life, &amp; be continually ſtriving againſt ſinne, &amp; bende all our affections to true holines.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:23951:214"/>we be, we muſt alwayes conſider our owne imperfections in our heartes, and humbly acknowledge them with our mouthes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the perfection of Chriſtians doeth more conſiſt in the remiſſion of their ſinnes, then in the perfection of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Thirdly, that the grace and mercie,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whereby God hath pardoned our ſinnes, doth preſerue and keepe the Church in her eſtate. Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that this grace hath raiſed vs vp when we were dead, and hath nowe made vs immortall, and that by it, beeing loſt we were founde, and ſhall nowe dwell for ever in our fathers houſe; being throwen downe, we are lifted vp; &amp; are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo well ſupported by the meanes hereof, that we need never to feare (provided alwayes that we lay holde thereof, and that through a curſed and arrogant opinion of our owne ſtrength and abilitie, or the power of any other creature whatſoever,<note place="margin">Sundrie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of this Doctor for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this point.</note> we doe not depart from it) falling into that horrible and fearefull pitte of death and deſtruction, wherein wee were before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe worthie ſayings of this holy Doctour, which are verie pregnant and plaine for the confirmation of that which we haue ſaid before, touching Chriſtian righteouſnes, he ſetteth downe alſo many excellent compariſons, whereby hee doeth moſt liuely ſet forth the trueth hereof. And firſt of all in his booke of the Citie of God, comparing it with the Sanctuarie of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> hee ſaith, that even as their citie was peopled in the beginning, by reaſon of that freedome and impunitie, which <hi>Rhemus</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> proclaimed and offered to all malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, which woulde come and inhabite there:<note n="1" place="margin">The Church is an aſſembly of ſinners, which God doth ſanctify and iuſtifie.</note> So likewiſe the Church of God is builded and gathered of all nations of the earth, by a generall pardon which God doeth offer vnto ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as will enter and dwell therein: with this condition, that they muſt deſire it, and truſt to obtaine it by his mercie through the merits of his Sonne <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whereby we may gather that to ſpeake properly and truely, the Church is nothing elſe but an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of idolatours, blaſphemers, infidels, rebels, ingratefull, diſloyall and barbarous men, murtherers, theeves, vſurers, ſlaunderers, backebiters, and ſuch like people, to whome God hath freely giuen his grace, thereby to ſaue them, in forgiving their offences, and releaſing that puniſhment which was due vnto them for their ſinnes. And againe writing vpon one of
<pb facs="tcp:23951:215"/>the Pſalmes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.2. <hi>The diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which hee healed, and the dead which he raiſed vp.</hi>
                  </note> he compareth God vnto a skilful <hi>Chirurgion,</hi> and a Chriſtian vnto a man that is moſt grievouſly and daungerouſly wounded, ſaying, that as a maymed man, who deſireth to bee healed, and to recover his former health, muſt not hyde his wounde but make it knowen vnto the ſurgeon, who by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing thereof, and laying his plaiſter to the ſore, doeth in a ſhort time heale it and make it as ſounde as his other partes. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if we will heale the maladies and diſeaſes of our ſoules, we muſt lay them open in Gods ſight by a true and hearty confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he muſt applie his plaiſter, that is, his mercie and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon which he muſt giue vs for all our faults and iniquities. In another place he likeneth our redemption to the deliverance of the people of Iſrael,<note n="3" place="margin">Howe that we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and maintained by the power and grace of of God, as were the children of Iſrael.</note> when as they were in captivitie in Egipt, and ſaith, that even as when they were delivered from the place where they had bin captives, their enemies which purſued them, were drowned in the red ſea. So likewiſe in Baptiſme, which is the beginning of our redemption, our ſinnes are waſhed away by the blood of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> After that they were entred into the wildernes, before they came into the promiſed land, they were conſtrained to fight with hunger and thirſt againſt heat, againſt thoſe ſolitary deſerts, againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> againſt venemous ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; other in numerable te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations: ſo likewiſe after that we haue bin called &amp; ſanctified, before we can enter into that eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; reſt which we hope for, we muſt firſt fight againſt the deuil, the world &amp; our owne concupiſcences. If at any time they were bitten with ſerpents, they had no other means to heale and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them ſelves, and to keepe them from their venim, but to lift vp their eyes, and to looke vpon the braſen ſerpent, which <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> by the commandement of God had erected to this purpoſe. So likewiſe if we be ſtung or hurt either by our enemies, or by the inordinate luſtes of our faith, whereby we lift vp the eyes of our heartes to behold <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> hanging vpon the Croſſe: We may beholde in this ſimilitude our righteouſnes very excellently and very fitly deſcribed, and that the greateſt part thereof conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the grace and mercie of God, which it pleaſeth him to beſtowe vpon vs, not onely when he calleth vs, but alſo ever after ſo long as wee live in this worlde, pardoneth our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions by his great goodneſſe, and for the loue of his onely
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23951:215"/>Sonne by whome wee are commended and reconciled vnto him.<note n="4" place="margin">Of the thiefe that was crucified who by his faith obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mercy at the hands of Chriſt Ieſus.</note> He alſo ſetteth downe another compariſon very fitte and agreeable to the ſame purpoſe: and that is of the two thieves, who ſuffered with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the which (ſaith he) al men both the godly and the vngodly are repreſented. If one ſhould examine the lives of theſe two poore &amp; wretched theeves, there would be found ſmall difference betweene them. For both of them were very wicked and naughty perſons, &amp; ſuch as had deſerved death by the lawes. In like maner there is no difference betweene the elect &amp; the reprobate; for both of them are vicious, not onely by nature, but alſo in converſation.<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1. Rom. 3.10.</note> And there is not one (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, &amp; likewiſe <hi>Paul)</hi> that doth good, &amp; that hath not deſerved a ſhamefull death at Gods handes, if he ſhould deale as men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. There is then no other diſtinction betweene them, but that which diſtinguiſheth the malefactors. For as the one was ſaved for that he did firſt acknowledge &amp; confeſſe his faults, and then that he to whom he confeſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was willing to pardon them: ſo likewiſe the difference betweene the elect &amp; the reprobate is this, that the one do acknowledge their ſinnes &amp; are heartily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them, and withal do continually crie vnto <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for helpe at his hands who was crucified for them: whereas on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, the other will not acknowledge their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; therefore they grow ſo proud, &amp; are puffed vp with ſuch a conceit of them ſelves, that they give them ſelves to all kind of ſenſualitie, &amp; wholy delite in things of this world, &amp; ſo in the end doe die both impenitent and obſtinate ſinners, neither doe they know <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but rather contemne and deſpiſe him, as that proude and mallepert thiefe did: yea they barke and bay at him, even as dogges doe at ſuch as are not of their acquaintance.</p>
               <p>This compariſon then made by this holy and excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, tendeth to this ende, to ſhew vs, that we are righteous as the thiefe was righteous: that is to ſay, by confeſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of our ſinnes, and by the remiſſion that wee obtaine by a lively faith in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And as our forefathers who were very wiſe and well aduiſed in many thinges, haue alwayes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto him theſe two names, <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>Thiefe,</hi> and that after his death, when as hee was nowe glorified, and reigned in Paradiſe with <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſignifying by one of the ſayde
<pb facs="tcp:23951:216"/>names what grace and favour God had ſhewed him: and by the other, the qualitie and deſert of his owne ſinne.

For in thus doing, wee alwayes giue the glorie of their juſtice and righteouſneſſe vnto the grace and favour of God. And to humble them withall, wee put them in minde what puniſhment they ſhoulde haue,<note n="5" place="margin">Is that of the moone which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth her light of the ſunne.</note> if God ſhoulde deale with them according vnto their deſartes. Nowe becauſe the greateſt and the beſt parte of the righteouſneſſe of all Chriſtians doe lye and conſiſt in Imputation, that is to ſay, in that God by the merittes and obedience of his Sonne <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doeth hold and account them iuſt and righteous, whenſoever they appeare before him in iudgement: this learned and godly father doeth compare the Church in another place to the Moone: and ſaith, that, as that is of it ſelfe darke and obſcure, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light but that which is borrowed of the Sunne: ſo likewiſe the Church hath no other righteouſneſſe, but that which is communicated to it, by the death and merites of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> from whome ſhee is no ſooner ſevered, but foorthwith ſhee is eclipſed, and remaineth in her naturall darkeneſſe and blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is farre more feareful, and is much thicker then that of the Moone, when it is declined from the Sunne. Wee may then fully reſolve, being enduced thereto by ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſayings and fitte compariſons of this ancient Doctor, that the firſt and principall part of our righteouſneſſe is in this, that it pleaſeth God to bee mercifull vnto vs, and to forgiue vs our ſinnes for the love of his Sonne <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whome alone wee ought to put our whole truſt and confidence, ſo long as wee are laden with this heauie burthen of corruptible and ſinnefull fleſh.</p>
               <p>Nowe as touching the ſeconde,<note place="margin">Of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which we owe vnto God.</note> which is the obedience and ſervice wee owe vnto God, and which wee ought in all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner to perfourme vnto him, after that hee hath once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived vs into his houſe, it conſiſteth (as <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) rather in a holy affection, then in any reall and eſſentiall effect. For all that wee can doe, or rather all that the grace of God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23951:216"/>worketh in vs ſo long as wee are in this worlde, is a deſire to ſerue and obey him: and when ſoever wee fayle hereof to make vs heartely ſoric for it, and in the acknowledging of our ſinnes, to make vs returne to him, and humbly to deſire and craue his mercie and pardon for them, and that it would pleaſe him to vouchſafe to take pitie of vs. Wee are herein very like vnto ſicke perſons, who deſire nothing ſo much as to bee in health, and to recover their former ſtrength: and therefore they are verie carefull to obſerue all the rules of phiſicke, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe they thinke may be availeable for the recoverie of their ſtrength and health: and yet for all that they can not be ſo carefull nor ſo watchfull over them ſelues, but that oftentimes they fall into their diſeaſes againe, and muſt needes haue the helpe of the phiſition.</p>
               <p>In like manner conſidering the feebleneſſe, and weakeneſſe of our ſoules, and their variable and vncertaine diſpoſition, wee had neede to meditate continually in the Lawe of God, which is the regiment of their health, and ſtrive (according to that meaſure of grace which hee hath giuen vs by his holy Spirite) to obſerve and followe it in all pointes ſo farre foorth as poſſibly we may. But although wee ſtuddie by all meanes that may bee to doe ſo, yet can we not bee ſo preciſe herein, neither yet ſo provident, but that wee ſhall fall into many grievous diſeaſes, and therefore we muſt (when we haue done what we can) haue our recourſe vnto this excellent and ſoveraigne receipt of the mercie of God, who wil haue pitie vpon vs, when as he ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it proceedeth not of any intemperance or euill dyet that wee keepe, but of a natural infirmitie that is in vs, that wee fall ſo often into our olde diſeaſes.<note place="margin">Another ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what obedience God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs.</note> For wee muſt not imagine that hee is like vnto ſome cruell and heard hearted creditour, which will not releaſe one pennie of that which is due vnto him, but will haue all payde and that to the vttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He is merciful vnto almen, yea to his enemies, &amp; therefore he will not be cruel &amp; vnmerciful vnto his children, and we may be wel aſſured, that as he hath ſhewed himſelf vnto our fathers, ſo he wil be vnto vs, &amp; therfore al though in ſtead of gold which we owe him, we haue nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g but iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet muſt we pluck vp good

For if hee once perceiue that wee are carefull, and that wee will take paines and doe what wee can to pay him that which wee owe, and as our power and abilitie will ſerve vs, hee will take pence for teaſters, and ſhillinges for crownes, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a little for all that wee owe him, and will accounte vs righteous, if hee once ſee in vs a will and deſire to doe that which is good and pleaſing in his ſight.<note place="margin">A third fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</note> Euen as wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accounte a good traveller, not onely him that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie gone his journey, but alſo ſuch an one as is readie preſt and willing to goe forwarde in his way. The concluſion then of this ſecond point is this, that to bee accounted righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is not requiſite that in all our thoughtes, counſels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, wordes, workes, and generally all our whole converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee ſhould bee ſo vpright and conformable vnto his will and Lawe, that wee ſhoulde not omit any thing of whatſoever is commanded vs (for that is impoſſible, conſidering the great and wonderfull corruption of our nature, and the miſerable and wretched eſtate wherein wee are) But it is onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, that wee ſhoulde humble our ſelves and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe that wee are miſerable and wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as wee haue alreadie prooved: And next vnto this, that wee repoſe our whole truſt and confidence in his mercies and promiſes which hee hath made vnto vs:<note place="margin">A ſummarie of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc, ewhich God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at our handes.</note> And thirdly, that wee preſent our ſelves before him in the Name and Mediation of his ſonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and for his ſake crave remiſſion and forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes: And finally, the the better to make manifeſt ſuch great and exceeding bountie and goodnes towards vs, we muſt conſecrate the reſt of our liues to the praiſe and honour of his Name, and ſeeke the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glorie ſo much as we may: humbly beſeeching him to continue his gracious and loving favour towardes vs, and to winke at ſuch faultes as he daily findeth in vs, and to accept of our good willes as of ſufficient duetyes, and to take the great and

               <p>It remaineth now that we vnderſtand what the reaſon is,<note n="3" place="margin">The reaſon why that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, wee ſtill feele ſo many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt God.</note> why that when he hath called &amp; regenerated vs, he will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe vs ſuch grace and fauour, as to keepe vs in his waies, and to make vs ſo perfect and abſolute, that there be no more any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie or contradiction to his will and pleaſure: that is to ſay; that we neither thinke any thing in our minds, nor loue any thing with our hearts, nor yet ſuffer our ſenſes to delight in that which is not conſonant and agreeable vnto his lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Many and eſpecially ſuch, as are moſt afraide to offend him, and are beſt affected toward his ſeruice, doe thinke with them ſelues, that if they could obtaine ſuch mercy at his hands, that they ſhould be moſt happie and fortunate, yea, and that then they ſhould liue a very angelical and holy life. Which I am perſwaded is moſt true: And I muſt needes confeſſe, that there can be no greater felicitie, then to loue God with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, and with all our ſtrength. But ſeeing that both experience, and the Scripture teacheth vs,<note n="1" place="margin">We are not yet capable of ſo great a good, neither is it expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that as yet, we ſhould haue the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition thereof.</note> that he will not beſtow ſuch grace and fauour vpon vs, and therefore that it is impoſſible that wee ſhould attaine vnto any ſuch perfection ſo long as we are in this life, I ſay, that we ought to be content with ſuch graces, as it pleaſeth God to beſtow vpon vs, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to beleeue and perſwade our ſelues, that we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo excellent and precious a treaſure.

Let vs, I pray you, conſider this alſo: that if ſo be our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> who was created in ſuch integritie and perfection, and in whome the graces of God ſhined in moſt bright and beautifull manner, was not able to reſiſt one ſmall and light temptation in Paradiſe, where he was, as it were, hedged about with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and loue of God: what ſhall wee doe, who liue in this wretched and miſerable world, where we are aſſaulted on euery ſide with ſo many and ſo furious temptations? and if hee, who

We cannot too often remember theſe two examples, ſeing they teach vs, that there is nothing more forceable, or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to humble vs and keepe vs in true feare of God, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and temptations: wherto we cannot but acknowledge our ſelues to be very ſubiect. For pride, which was the firſt ſinne wherewith we were infected, is alſo (as the ſame holy Doctor ſaith in many of his bookes) the laſt corruption which departeth from vs, and there is nothing in this world that we are ſo long in learning of, nor ſo difficult for a man to practiſe, as to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lowly, and to thinke baſely of himſelfe.

                  </note> who in remembring their horrible and fearefull offences, doe vtterly deſpaire of the remiſſion of them, for that they are perſwaded, that God will examine euery thing that is amiſſe very ſtraightly &amp; very ſeuerely.

And that this is true, it doth manifeſtly appeere by the examples of ſuch as are deade already, as alſo what ſhall be the eſtate and condicion of the children of God, after their departure out of this life.<note place="margin">Examples for the proofe of that which we haue ſaide before.</note> Was not <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſoule immediatly after his death, caried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome?

Which examples haue beene left vnto vs in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not onely to declare the great goodnes &amp; mercie of God towards them, but alſo to manifeſt what grace and fauour hee is purpoſed to beſtowe vpon all true Chriſtians, whoſe liues and actions ſhalbe no more examined, then were thoſe of the perſons before mentioned. And we muſt not think, that he entertaineth them otherwiſe,<note place="margin">By ſimilituds</note> then a louing father doth his children, when as they come to his houſe, or that he ſpeaketh of any thing, but that which may miniſter comfort and conſolation vnto them.

We then, who are iuſtified by his grace, neede not feare the rigour and ſeueritie of his iudgements, or diſpaire of the remiſſion of our ſinnes, but the conſideration of them is very feareful to the wicked, who by reaſon of their ſinne and infidelitie, are culpable in his ſight.

The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> when as we compare our ſelues with thoſe who haue bene, or are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent accounted vertuous and godly men.

But herein we are many waies deceiued. And firſt of all, that we imagine that the righteouſnes of a Chriſtian doth conſiſt in his works, and not in the remiſſion of his ſinnes. For though that <hi>Abraham</hi> was charitable, patient, milde, lowly and careful to do his duetie in euery thing, yet for all that, he was not righteous in the ſight of God, but onely by that grace, which it pleaſed God to impart vnto him, by imputing vnto him the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his Sonne, through the faith which he had in his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> Secondly, if we will iudge of mens vertues, we muſt paſſe ouer many of their faults, as their corrupt natures, their vaine words, their wicked imaginations, their leude affections, &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted hearts: al which we ſhould carefully &amp; diligently examine, before we can pronounce them righteous according to the law. Nowe there is no queſtion, but the moſt vpright man that euer was, hath infinitely tranſgreſſed herein, as it may moſt plainly be prooued by their owne confeſſions: and therefore we muſt not thinke, that they haue bin exempted from ſinne, though that all their faults be not reuealed vnto vs: neither ſhould our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions make vs imagine that we are not in the fauour of God, as well as they were, though that our ſinnes be greater in nomber and more grieuous then theirs.<note place="margin">The thirde.</note> Thirdly, wee erre greatly, in that we doe not conſider, that righteouſnes, faith, hope, patience, charitie, humilitie and other vertues, are qualities which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or diminiſhed, or (to ſpeak as the Philoſophers do) which are capable of more and of leſſe. For albeit they haue bene more charitable and more faithfull then we are, and we leſſe then they: yet it followeth not, but that both the one and the other may be iuſtified by that faith, which it pleaſeth God to impart vnto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to that meaſure &amp; portion which it pleaſeth him to thinke expedient, as wel for his glorie, as for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

It is certen that they are the eldeſt ſonnes (as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith) becauſe they haue not ſinned at all, but we are the youngeſt, for that (after the example of the prodigall childe) wee doe repent vs and are heartily ſorie for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>There is alſo one thing more,<note n="8" place="margin">Againſt the temptation proceeding of the great wants that are in vs.</note> which doth greatly trouble our conſciences, &amp; doth often make vs doubt whether we be of the nomber of Gods children, &amp; that we haue the mercy of God to iuſtifie vs, or not. And that is: when we doe not finde in ourſelues a liuely &amp; feruent faith, either in praying vnto God, or in praiſing of his holy name in confeſſing of his bountie towardes vs. The better to arme vs againſt this temptation,<note place="margin">The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> we muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d firſt of all, that the holines &amp; ſanctitie of the Church is ſet downe and propounded vnto vs, as an vndoubted article of our faith, to the end that we ſhould not make any queſtion thereof, though it be not ſo apparant &amp; ſenſible, as are the coulers &amp; ſauours of ſweet &amp; delightſome flowers. Euen as then we doe not thinke that the fire which is raked vp in the aſhes, is cleane put out,<note place="margin">A confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes.</note> though that neither the light appeareth, nor yet the heate thereof can be diſcerned: and as that tree is not dead, which in winter hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaues, bloſſoms, nor fruite vpon it, nor yet any other thing which may be as a ſigne of the life that is hid within it: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may not we be ſaid to be without faith, for that ſometimes it ſeemeth to be buried &amp; ſmothered in vs. Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond remedie.</note> we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the ſpirit of God is like vnto a winde which bloweth when &amp; where it liſteth. Seeing then, that we are very vnfit to ſet forth the praiſes of God, vnleſſe it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our lippes, &amp; that our pipes cannot reſound theſe wonderfull graces which we haue receiued, if God him ſelf do not ſet them in tune, we muſt patiently wait for the time, wherin it ſhal pleaſe him to enſpire vs, &amp; take heed that we do not refuſe it when ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaſeth him to offer it vnto vs, or be ſlacke in aſking of it, when we feele ſuch cold and froſen affections within vs.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe &amp; intention hath bin hitherto,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A briefe ſumme of this whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, deuided into</hi> 7. <hi>books.</hi>
                  </note> to ſhew the great &amp; wonderful diſtemperature of our vnruly &amp; diſordered paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; and as plainly as I could, to decipher vnto euery one, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde daungers whereinto they violently driue vs, if they
<pb facs="tcp:23951:221"/>be not bridled with the rules of reaſon, and, as it were, tamed and made gentle by diſcreete handling. Imitating herein the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> who were accuſtomed to make their ſlaues drunke, and afterwards to ſhewe them to their children, that they ſeeing their filthie behauiour and loathſome countenances, might be the rather induced to auoide all intemperance what ſoeuer. In like manner my whole ſcope and purpoſe hath beene in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſhewe, what diſorder and confuſion vnruly deſires and vntamed humours haue bred and hatched in all ſuch perſons, as haue beene ſlaues to their owne affections, to the end, that euery one that hunger and thirſt after a peaceable and quiet eſtate, may plainly perceiue, that there is no other meanes to attain their wiſhed end, but onely to curb them ſhort, and ride them with a ſharp bit, for that they are very headſtrong and vnruly jades. For euen as a gold ring doth not ſo ſoone touch a goutie or diſeaſed finger,<note place="margin">A fit ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> but that preſently it cauſeth great and intolerable griefe: ſo likewiſe the humours, riches, pleaſures, and profit of this world, doe nothing elſe but moleſt and trouble our minds, either with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or couetouſnes. Which paſſions are euen as pricks and eating ſoares or vlcers at the heart, which bite and gnawe continually, neuer ſuffering it to take reſt, or to liue at eaſe and contentedly.<note place="margin">An other ſimilitude.</note> And herein they doe ſomewhat reſemble our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or agues, the heat and cold whereof, though they be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, yet are they more extreame and more painful to be endured, then the coldeſt or whoteſt ſeaſon of all the yeere. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is no fire what ſo euer, whoſe heat is ſo forceable, as is the ſcorching flame of our owne concupiſcences. We muſt then take all the paines that may be to quench it: which we ſhall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in time, if we doe carefully remember, and diligently put in practiſe that which hath bin before rehearſed. For euen as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with theſe great maſtifes which wee nouriſh, the better to keepe our goods from ſtealing and pilfering away,<note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in his treatiſe of the contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde.</hi>
                  </note> though they barke neuer ſo fiercely, yet if they be rebuked by the maſter of the houſe, to whoſe voyce they are accuſtomed, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deſiſt and leaue off from further ſtirring: ſo likewiſe the moſt furious and violent paſſion that may be, wil ſoone be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, if they be accuſtomed to be rebuked by reaſon, and not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to barke and bay at their owne pleaſures. But aboue al things
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23951:221"/>we muſt ſeriouſly pray vnto the Almighty, as we haue ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the beginning, to vouchſafe vs continually the ayde and comforte of his holy ſpirite, that thereby we may be enabled to maſter them. For if it pleaſeth not him to open our eyes,<note place="margin">The true and effectuall meanes to reape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie by that which hath bene before ſpoken</note> and vnſtoppe our eares, we ſhall never be able of our ſelves either to ſee or vnderſtand his trueth, neither will our heartes be fitte to receiue the print thereof, if they be not mollifyed and ſoftened by the working of his holy ſpirite.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now that we be humble and earneſt ſuiters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that it would pleaſe him for his ſonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> ſake, to enlighten the eyes of our mindes, that wee may perfectly ſee the vanitie of thoſe thinges which we ſo carefully followe, and the true perfect happines of that which we ſo warily ſhun &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe. And furthermore that he would vouchſafe to turne our heartes from all ſuch thinges as may in any wiſe moleſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet vs, and that by the direction of his holy Spirit, we may ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeeke after that which is alwayes accompanied with an aſſured reſt and a ioyful contentation.</p>
